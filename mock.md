To prepare for a PPL oral checkride across **FAA (USA)**, **EASA (Europe)**, and **CAAT (Thailand)**, you need to be ready for "trigger" questions. Examiners use scenarios to test if you can *apply* the rules, not just recite them.

Below is a comprehensive list of realistic questions and the "Gold Standard" answers for your checkride.

---

## 1. Pilot Qualifications & Medical

**Q: You just passed your checkride today (Jan 21, 2026). When does your pilot certificate expire?**

* **Answer:** The certificate itself does not expire. However, my *privileges* to fly expire if I do not maintain currency (Flight Review every 24 calendar months) or if my Medical Certificate expires.

**Q: Your friend offers to pay for the entire flight today because you are doing him a favor. Is this legal?**

* **FAA/CAAT:** No. I must pay at least my "pro-rata" (equal) share of the operating expenses (fuel, oil, airport fees).
* **EASA:** Generally similar, though cost-sharing is allowed for non-complex aircraft, the pilot cannot make a profit.

**Q: You have a head cold and took some over-the-counter medicine. Can you fly?**

* **Answer:** I must use the **I'M SAFE** checklist. Even if the medicine is "allowed," if I have sinus congestion, a descent could cause an "ear block" or "sinus block," which is a safety hazard. I should consult an AME or the FAA/EASA/CAAT "approved medications" list.

## 2. Airworthiness & Equipment

**Q: How do you know this airplane is legal to fly today?**

* **Answer:** I check the **A.R.R.O.W.** documents (Airworthiness, Registration, Radio License [Intl], Operating Handbook, Weight & Balance) and the **A.V.I.A.T.E.S.** maintenance logs to ensure the Annual, Transponder (24 mo), and ELT (12 mo) inspections are current.

**Q: During preflight, you find the Landing Light is broken. Can you fly?**

* **Answer:** I follow the decision flow:
1. Is it required by **91.205/Part-NCO** (ATOMATOFLAMES)? (No, not for VFR Day).
2. Is it required by the **Kinds of Operation List** in the POH?
3. If not required, I must **deactivate and placard** it "INOPERATIVE." (Note: If it's an **SLSA BushCat**, I must check if the manufacturer allows flying with it broken).

## 3. Weather & Performance

**Q: The METAR shows a "Temp 20 / Dewpoint 19" spread. What does this tell you?**

* **Answer:** The air is near saturation. I should expect **fog or low clouds** to form shortly as the temperature drops toward the dewpoint.

**Q: How will high density altitude (hot day in Thailand) affect your takeoff?**

* **Answer:** It will increase my takeoff roll distance and decrease my rate of climb. The engine produces less power because the air is less dense, and the propeller is less efficient.

**Q: What are the three things a thunderstorm needs to form?**

* **Answer:** 1. Unstable air, 2. High moisture content, 3. A lifting force (like a front or a mountain).

## 4. Airspace & Charts

**Q: (Pointing to a Blue Shaded Circle on a Chart) What airspace is this, and what do you need to enter?**

* **Answer:** That is **Class B** airspace. I need a specific **ATC Clearance** ("Cleared to enter Class Bravo"), a two-way radio, and a Mode C transponder (ADS-B).

**Q: You are flying at 4,500 feet MSL. What are your VFR weather minimums?**

* **Answer (FAA/CAAT/EASA):** In most controlled airspace (Class C/D/E) below 10,000', it is **3-152**: 3 miles visibility, 1,000' above, 500' below, and 2,000' horizontal from clouds.

---

## 5. Aerodynamics & Emergencies

**Q: You are in a steep turn and the plane starts to buffeting. What is happening?**

* **Answer:** I am approaching an **Accelerated Stall**. Because of the high bank angle, the load factor (G-load) has increased, which has raised my stall speed. I must decrease the bank or push the nose forward.

**Q: What is your "ABCDE" procedure for an engine failure?**

* **Answer:** * **A**irspeed: Establish Best Glide (**Vg**).
* **B**est Place to Land: Pick a field.
* **C**hecklist: Try to restart (Fuel on, Carb Heat, Magnetos).
* **D**eclare: Squawk 7700 and call Mayday on 121.5.
* **E**xecute: Emergency landing.



**Q: What do you do if you accidentally fly into a cloud (VFR into IMC)?**

* **Answer:** I must rely on my **flight instruments**, not my "seat of the pants" feeling. I should perform a standard-rate 180-degree turn to fly back into the clear air while maintaining altitude and heading.

### Checkride "Pro" Tip

Whenever you answer a question, try to end with: **"And I can verify that in Section [X] of the POH"** or **"In the FAR/AIM [or TCAR/EASA Part-FCL]."** Showing the examiner you know *where* the information is located is just as important as knowing the answer.

Here are 10 additional high-probability, scenario-based questions designed to test your **application** of knowledge for the PPL oral exam.

### 1. The "Forward CG" Scenario

**Q: You are flying your BushCat alone with no baggage. Your Center of Gravity (CG) is at the forward limit. How does this affect your stall speed and cruise speed?**

* **Answer:** A forward CG makes the airplane more stable but **increases the stall speed**. The tail has to produce more "downward lift" to balance the nose, which makes the wings work harder (higher wing loading). Because the wings are creating more lift, they create more **induced drag**, which **decreases your cruise speed**.

### 2. The "Overweight" Performance

**Q: It’s a hot day in Thailand (High Density Altitude), and you are at the Maximum Takeoff Weight. What specific risks do you face?**

* **Answer:** I will have a significantly longer takeoff roll and a much shallower climb gradient. My **Vso** (Stall speed) is higher when the plane is heavy. I must calculate my performance to ensure I can clear obstacles at the end of the runway, as the plane might "mush" instead of climbing.

### 3. Special VFR (SVFR)

**Q: You are 5 miles from a Class D airport. The ATIS says visibility is 2 miles and the ceiling is 800 feet. Can you land?**

* **Answer:** Not under normal VFR (which requires 3 miles and 1,000' ceiling). However, I can request a **Special VFR Clearance** from ATC. To do this, I must remain **clear of clouds** and have at least **1 mile of flight visibility**. (Note: At night, I would also need to be Instrument Rated).

### 4. Magneto Failure

**Q: During cruise, you notice the engine starts running "rough" and you see a slight drop in RPM. What is the likely cause and your first action?**

* **Answer:** This is likely a fouled spark plug or a failing magneto. I will first try to "clear" the plugs by leaning the mixture. If it continues, I will momentarily switch from "Both" to "Left" then "Right" on the ignition switch to identify which magneto is failing. I will then fly on the "Good" magneto and head for the nearest airport.

### 5. Accidentally Entering a Cloud (VMC to IMC)

**Q: You inadvertently enter a cloud. Your body feels like the plane is turning left, but the Attitude Indicator shows you are straight and level. What do you do?**

* **Answer:** I am experiencing a **Somatogravic Illusion** (The Leans). I must ignore my physical sensations and **trust my instruments**. I will perform a standard-rate 180-degree turn using the Turn Coordinator and Heading Indicator to exit the cloud the way I came in.

### 6. Carburetor Heat Logic

**Q: You apply Carburetor Heat and the RPM *drops* and the engine runs *rougher*. What should you do?**

* **Answer:** I should **leave the Carb Heat on**. The drop and roughness mean ice is melting and water is being sucked into the engine. After the ice is gone, the RPM will rise slightly (though it will stay lower than the "cold air" RPM due to the warm, less dense air).

### 7. The "Oxygen" Question

**Q: You want to fly at 13,000 feet MSL to get over some mountains. What are the rules for supplemental oxygen?**

* **FAA:** The required flight crew must use oxygen if at that altitude for more than 30 minutes.
* **EASA/CAAT:** Generally, oxygen is required for the crew for the *entire* duration above 10,000 feet. At 13,000 feet, I would likely need it for myself and potentially offer it to passengers.

### 8. Wake Turbulence Avoidance

**Q: You are landing behind a Boeing 737. Where should you aim to touch down?**

* **Answer:** I should stay **above** the large aircraft's flight path and touch down **beyond** the point where the large aircraft’s nose wheel touched the runway. This ensures I stay above the wingtip vortices which sink and spread.

### 9. Systems: Alternator Failure

**Q: Your "Low Voltage" light comes on and the Ammeter shows a discharge. What is your plan?**

* **Answer:** The alternator has likely failed. The engine will continue to run (because magnetos are self-powered), but I am now on **Battery Power**. I will turn off all non-essential electronics (Landing lights, secondary radios, transponder if not in busy airspace) to save the battery for my flaps and primary radio for the landing.

### 10. Determining Airworthiness (The "Logbook" Question)

**Q: (The examiner hands you the aircraft logs). Show me that the Transponder is legal for today's flight.**

* **Answer:** I would look for an entry dated within the last **24 calendar months** stating the transponder was tested and inspected according to **91.413** (FAA) or the equivalent local regulation.
