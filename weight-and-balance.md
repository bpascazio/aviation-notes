### Detailed Effects

#### Too Forward CG (Ahead of Forward Limit)

**Takeoff Performance:**
- **Difficult to rotate**: Requires excessive elevator force or may be unable to rotate
- **Longer takeoff distance**: Aircraft takes longer to reach rotation speed
- **Higher rotation speed**: May need higher speed to generate enough lift on tail
- **Reduced climb performance**: Even if rotation is achieved, climb may be poor

**Landing Performance:**
- **Difficult to flare**: Hard to raise nose for landing flare
- **Harder to land smoothly**: May land nose-wheel first
- **Bounce risk**: May bounce on landing due to inability to flare properly
- **Ground loop risk**: Nose-heavy condition can cause directional control issues

**Flight Characteristics:**
- **More stable**: Aircraft is more stable longitudinally
- **Nose-heavy tendency**: Aircraft wants to pitch down
- **Reduced elevator authority**: Less effective elevator control
- **Requires more elevator force**: Pilot must use more force to control pitch

**Stall Recovery:**
- **Easier to recover**: Forward CG makes recovery easier
- **More nose-down moment**: Natural tendency to lower nose aids recovery

**Safety:**
- **Cannot legally fly**: Aircraft is not airworthy if CG is forward of limit
- **May be unable to take off**: Critical safety issue
- **Ground handling issues**: Difficult to taxi and control on ground

#### Too Aft CG (Behind Aft Limit)

**Takeoff Performance:**
- **Easier to rotate**: May rotate too easily or too early
- **Premature rotation risk**: May rotate before reaching proper speed
- **Reduced stability**: Less stable during takeoff roll

**Landing Performance:**
- **Easier to flare**: May flare too high or balloon
- **Overshoot risk**: May float and overshoot landing
- **Harder to control**: Less stable during approach and landing

**Flight Characteristics:**
- **Less stable**: Aircraft is less stable longitudinally
- **Tail-heavy tendency**: Aircraft wants to pitch up
- **Light elevator forces**: Controls feel light and over-sensitive
- **Over-sensitive controls**: Small control inputs have large effects

**Stall Recovery:**
- **Harder to recover**: Aft CG makes stall recovery difficult
- **May be unrecoverable**: Can lead to loss of control
- **Spin risk**: More likely to enter spin and harder to recover
- **Deep stall risk**: May enter deep stall that is unrecoverable

**Safety:**
- **Cannot legally fly**: Aircraft is not airworthy if CG is aft of limit
- **Loss of control risk**: Critical safety issue
- **Unrecoverable stall**: May be unable to recover from stall
- **Structural damage**: May exceed structural limits during recovery attempts

#### Overloaded (Exceeding Maximum Weight)

**Takeoff Performance:**
- **Longer takeoff distance**: Significantly increased distance required
- **Higher takeoff speed**: Must reach higher speed before rotation
- **Reduced climb rate**: Poor rate of climb, may not clear obstacles
- **Reduced angle of climb**: Shallow climb angle
- **May not clear obstacles**: Critical for short or obstructed runways
- **Longer time to altitude**: Takes much longer to reach safe altitude

**Landing Performance:**
- **Longer landing distance**: Significantly increased distance required
- **Higher approach speed**: Must fly faster on approach
- **Higher touchdown speed**: Lands at higher speed
- **More runway required**: May exceed available runway length
- **Higher stress on landing gear**: Increased risk of landing gear failure

**Flight Characteristics:**

- **Reduced service ceiling**: Cannot climb as high

**Structural Considerations:**
- **Exceeds design limits**: Aircraft structure not designed for excess weight
- **Structural damage risk**: May cause permanent damage to airframe
- **Fatigue life reduced**: Accelerates structural fatigue
- **Load factor limits**: May exceed structural limits at lower speeds
- **G-force limitations**: Lower G-force tolerance

**Performance Degradation:**
- **Increased fuel consumption**: Burns more fuel
- **Reduced range**: Cannot fly as far
- **Reduced cruise speed**: May not reach normal cruise speed
- **Higher power required**: Must use more power for same performance

**Safety:**
- **Cannot legally fly**: Exceeding maximum weight is illegal
- **Structural failure risk**: May cause structural failure
- **Loss of control risk**: Reduced controllability
- **Emergency handling**: Poor performance in emergency situations
- **Single-engine performance**: For twins, may not maintain altitude on one engine

### Critical Reminders

1. **Never exceed maximum weight** - This is a structural limit that must never be exceeded
2. **CG must be within limits** - Both forward and aft limits must be respected
3. **Check both weight and CG** - Aircraft must be within both limits
4. **Calculate before every flight** - Weight and balance must be verified before each flight
5. **Consider fuel burn** - CG may shift during flight as fuel is consumed
6. **Use actual weights** - Use actual weights when possible, standard weights when necessary
7. **Verify calculations** - Always double-check weight and balance calculations
8. **Aircraft is unairworthy** - If weight or CG is outside limits, aircraft cannot legally fly

## Basic Concepts

### Weight Terms

- **Empty Weight**: Weight of aircraft with no fuel, oil, passengers, or cargo
- **Basic Empty Weight**: Empty weight plus standard equipment
- **Useful Load**: Maximum takeoff weight minus empty weight
- **Payload**: Weight of passengers, baggage, and cargo
- **Maximum Takeoff Weight (MTOW)**: Maximum weight for takeoff
- **Maximum Landing Weight**: Maximum weight for landing
- **Maximum Zero Fuel Weight**: Maximum weight without fuel

### Balance Terms

- **Center of Gravity (CG)**: Point where aircraft would balance if suspended
- **CG Limits**: Forward and aft limits within which aircraft is safe to fly
- **CG Range**: Acceptable range of CG positions
- **Moment**: Weight × Arm (used in calculations)
- **Arm**: Distance from reference datum
- **Reference Datum**: Point from which all arms are measured (usually firewall or nose)

## Calculations

### FAA Questions

**Q: How do you calculate the center of gravity?**

A: 
1. List all items (empty weight, fuel, passengers, baggage, etc.)
2. Find the weight of each item
3. Find the arm (distance from reference datum) for each item
4. Calculate moment for each item: Weight × Arm = Moment
5. Add all weights to get total weight
6. Add all moments to get total moment
7. Calculate CG: Total Moment ÷ Total Weight = CG Arm
8. Check if CG is within limits on weight and balance graph

**Q: What is a moment and why is it used?**

A: Moment = Weight × Arm. It's used because it accounts for both the weight and its location relative to the reference datum. A heavy item close to the datum has less moment than a lighter item far from the datum.

**Q: How do you find the arm for fuel?**

A: The fuel arm is usually found in the aircraft's weight and balance data. It's typically measured from the reference datum to the fuel tank's center. For multiple tanks, each tank may have a different arm.

**Q: What is the reference datum?**

A: The reference datum is an imaginary vertical plane from which all horizontal distances (arms) are measured. It's usually located at the firewall, nose, or a specific point defined by the manufacturer. All arms are measured from this point.

**Q: How do you calculate CG if you add or remove weight?**

A: 
1. Calculate the moment of the item being added/removed: Weight × Arm = Moment
2. If adding: Add weight and moment to totals
3. If removing: Subtract weight and moment from totals
4. Recalculate CG: New Total Moment ÷ New Total Weight = New CG Arm
5. Verify new CG is within limits

**Q: What is the difference between forward and aft CG?**

A: 
- **Forward CG**: Closer to nose, more stable but harder to rotate on takeoff, may require more elevator force
- **Aft CG**: Closer to tail, less stable, easier to stall, may be harder to recover from stall

**Q: How do you use a weight and balance graph?**

A: 
1. Calculate total weight
2. Calculate CG position (arm)
3. Plot weight on vertical axis
4. Plot CG on horizontal axis
5. Check if point falls within the envelope (CG limits)
6. If outside envelope, aircraft is out of limits

### EASA Questions

**Q: What information is required for weight and balance calculations?**

A: 
- Empty weight and empty weight CG
- Fuel quantity and fuel arm
- Passenger weights and passenger arms
- Baggage weight and baggage arm
- Any additional equipment or modifications
- Reference datum location

**Q: How do you account for fuel burn during flight?**

A: Fuel burn shifts CG as fuel is consumed. For long flights, you should:
1. Calculate CG at takeoff
2. Calculate CG at landing (with reduced fuel)
3. Ensure both are within limits
4. Some aircraft have fuel tanks that affect CG differently as fuel burns

**Q: What is the effect of loading order on weight and balance?**

A: Loading order doesn't affect the final CG position, but it can affect:
- Ground handling during loading
- Taxiing with different load distributions
- However, the final calculated CG is what matters for flight

**Q: How do you calculate weight and balance for a flight with multiple fuel tanks?**

A: 
1. Determine fuel quantity in each tank
2. Find the arm for each tank
3. Calculate moment for each tank: Fuel Weight × Tank Arm
4. Sum all fuel weights and moments
5. Include in total weight and balance calculation

### Thailand CAAT Questions

A: No, never. Maximum takeoff weight is a structural limit that must never be exceeded, regardless of flight duration or conditions.

**Q: How do you load passengers and baggage to stay within CG limits?**

A: 
1. Calculate weight and balance with planned loading
2. If CG is forward, move weight aft (if possible)
3. If CG is aft, move weight forward
4. Redistribute passengers or baggage as needed
5. Recalculate to ensure CG is within limits

**Q: What happens if you're over maximum weight?**

A: The aircraft cannot legally or safely take off. You must:
- Remove weight (fuel, passengers, or baggage)
- Or use a different aircraft
- Never exceed maximum weight limits

**Q: Can you load more if you're under maximum weight but at CG limit?**

A: No. You must stay within both weight limits AND CG limits. Even if under maximum weight, if you're at a CG limit, you cannot add more weight without moving existing weight or ensuring the new weight doesn't move CG outside limits.

**Q: How do you account for baggage in the baggage compartment?**

A: 
1. Weigh or estimate baggage weight
2. Find the baggage compartment arm from weight and balance data
3. Calculate baggage moment: Baggage Weight × Baggage Arm

**Q: How do you handle a situation where you're at maximum weight but need to add emergency equipment?**

A: 
1. Calculate new weight with emergency equipment
2. If over maximum weight, you must remove equivalent weight
3. Recalculate CG to ensure it remains within limits
4. Document the change in weight and balance

**Q: What is maximum zero fuel weight?**

A: Maximum weight of aircraft without fuel. This is a structural limit that ensures the aircraft structure can support the weight of fuel, passengers, and cargo. Fuel weight is not included in this limit.

**Q: How do you load for best performance?**

A: 
- Load within weight and CG limits
- Forward CG generally provides better stability

## Practical Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Basic Weight and Balance

**Scenario**: Calculate weight and balance for a flight with:
- Empty weight: 1,500 lbs at arm 100.0
- Pilot: 180 lbs at arm 85.0
- Passenger: 160 lbs at arm 85.0
- Fuel: 240 lbs at arm 95.0
- Baggage: 40 lbs at arm 140.0

**Solution**:
1. Empty Weight: 1,500 lbs × 100.0 = 150,000 lb-in
2. Pilot: 180 lbs × 85.0 = 15,300 lb-in
3. Passenger: 160 lbs × 85.0 = 13,600 lb-in
4. Fuel: 240 lbs × 95.0 = 22,800 lb-in
5. Baggage: 40 lbs × 140.0 = 5,600 lb-in
6. **Total**: 2,120 lbs, **Total Moment**: 207,300 lb-in
7. **CG**: 207,300 ÷ 2,120 = **97.8 inches**

### Example 2: CG Shift

**Q: If you move 50 lbs of baggage from arm 140.0 to arm 80.0, how does CG change?**

**Solution**:
- Original moment: 50 × 140.0 = 7,000 lb-in
- New moment: 50 × 80.0 = 3,000 lb-in
- Moment change: 7,000 - 3,000 = 4,000 lb-in (reduction)
- CG shift: 4,000 ÷ 2,120 = **1.9 inches forward**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Using maximum weight instead of actual weight in calculations
- ❌ Forgetting to account for fuel burn during flight
- ❌ Not checking CG at both takeoff and landing weights
- ❌ Assuming loading order doesn't matter (it doesn't for final CG, but matters for safety)
- ❌ Exceeding weight or CG limits "just a little bit"
- ❌ Not using current weight and balance data
- ❌ Forgetting to include all items (pilot, passengers, baggage, fuel, equipment)
- ❌ Using wrong arms from weight and balance data
- ❌ Not verifying calculations
- ❌ Not checking weight and balance graph after calculations

## Important Reminders

1. **Weight and balance must be calculated before every flight**
2. **Both weight and CG must be within limits**
