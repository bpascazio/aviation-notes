This guide covers the essentials of weather and safety information for pilots operating under **FAA** (USA), **EASA** (Europe), and **CAAT** (Thailand) jurisdictions.

## 1. PIREPs (Pilot Reports)

**What it is:** Actual weather conditions encountered by aircraft in flight.

* **Routine (UA):** Standard observations (cloud tops, flight visibility).
* **Urgent (UUA):** Hazardous conditions like severe icing, extreme turbulence, volcanic ash, or tornadoes.

### Why PIREPs Matter

* **Reality Check:** Forecasts are "guesses"; PIREPs are facts. If a METAR says "Clear" but a PIREP says "Moderate Turbulence at 8,000ft," trust the PIREP.
* **Closing the Gap:** They help ATC and forecasters update AIRMETs and SIGMETs.
* **Thailand (CAAT) Note:** PIREPs are vital in Thailand during the monsoon season for reporting the actual height of thunderstorm tops and the intensity of "Microbursts" or wind shear, which are common but hard to predict.

## 2. SIGMETs vs. AIRMETs

These are advisories for potentially hazardous weather.

| Feature | AIRMET (WA) | SIGMET (WS) | Convective SIGMET (WST) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Severity** | Moderate | Severe / Extreme | Severe (Thunderstorm related) |
| **Target** | Mainly Light Aircraft | **All** Aircraft | **All** Aircraft |
| **Hazards** | IFR, Mt. Obscuration, Mod Turbulence/Icing | Severe Icing, CAT, Volcanic Ash, Dust Storms | Line of Storms, Tornadoes, Hail (>3/4") |

> **FAA vs. EASA/CAAT Difference:** > * The FAA uses **G-AIRMETs** (graphical) and text AIRMETs (Sierra, Tango, Zulu).
> * In EASA and CAAT regions, you will primarily deal with **SIGMETs** for significant hazards. AIRMETs in these regions are often issued specifically for low-level flights (below FL100 or FL150).

## 3. NOTAMs (Notices to Airmen)

NOTAMs are non-weather-related safety alerts, but they often impact how you handle weather (e.g., if an Instrument Landing System (ILS) is down during low visibility).

* **L (Local):** Taxiway closures, lighting outages.
* **D (Distant):** Runway closures, navigation aid outages.
* **FDC (Flight Data Center):** Changes to instrument charts or TFRs (Temporary Flight Restrictions).
* **Thailand (CAAT) Specifics:** Look for "Kite Flying" or "Lantern" NOTAMs during festivals (Loy Krathong), which are unique hazards in Thai airspace.

## 4. Pre-Flight Checklist: Weather & Safety

Before you start the engine, verify these sources:

1. **Big Picture:** Check the Surface Analysis Chart for fronts and pressure systems.
2. **Terminal Areas:** METARs (current) and TAFs (forecast) for departure, destination, and alternates.
3. **The Route:** Check **SIGMETs** for the entire flight path.
4. **NOTAMs:** Check for runway closures or NAVAID outages that could prevent an approach if weather deteriorates.
5. **Performance:** In **Thailand (CAAT)**, pay close attention to "Density Altitude." High humidity and high temperatures (often >35°C) significantly degrade takeoff and climb performance.

## 5. In-Flight: What to Watch

* **ATIS/AWOS:** Listen for "Trend" forecasts at the end of the report (common in EASA/CAAT).
* **The 10-knot Rule:** If you experience airspeed fluctuations of  knots or more, report it as **Low-Level Wind Shear (LLWS)**.
* **Visual Cues:**
* **Lenticular Clouds:** High-altitude "UFO" clouds indicate severe mountain wave turbulence.
* **Towering Cumulus:** In the tropics (Thailand), these can turn into full thunderstorms in less than 15 minutes.


* **Communication:** If you encounter weather that wasn't forecast, **file a PIREP**. Use the format: *Position, Time, Altitude, Aircraft Type, and the Hazard.*

## Quick Reference Summary

* **FAA (USA):** Use [AviationWeather.gov](https://www.aviationweather.gov) for G-AIRMETs and PIREPs.
* **EASA (Europe):** Check the national AIS/MET provider (e.g., DWD in Germany, Meteo France).
* **CAAT (Thailand):** Use the [Thai Meteorological Department (TMD) Aviation Division](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.aviation.tmd.go.th).
