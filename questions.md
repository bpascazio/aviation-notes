The "Secret" Answer: "I don't have that specific number memorized, but I know exactly where to find it in the AIP (Aeronautical Information Publication) or the POH."

Performance decreases forward CG and increases aft CG

VOR Radial - if I am standing on a VOR and try to shoot you FROM here what does my compass on my gun say

QDM - to Station QDR - from Station QTE - True direction from QUJ - True direction to

(top altitude - bottom altitude) / 1000 * 3 = TOD distance from target
ground speed * 2 / 10 = rate of decent to keep FPM

1:60 rule
(Dist. Off / Dist. Flown) * 60 ...2 miles off after 60 miles = 2deg Error
(Dist. Off / Dist. Left) * 60 ...2 miles off with 30 miles to go = 4deg Cor Angle
Correction is turn 2+4=6 toward track

Climb into a headwind, dive away from a tailwind.

121.5 emergency frequency

Thailand transition altitude 11000 transition level FL130

Magnetic variation in Thailand 1 Deg West in Thailand West is best so add 1 to your True heading.

ISA 1013.2 hPa 15 degress C -1.98 C every 1000 ft -1 hPa = +30ft Alt

Magnetic track East is odd.

Density altitude decrease with height is 120 feet per degree C

"CAVOK" is visibility 10km+, no cloud below 5,000ft (or highest minimum sector altitude), and no significant weather (CB/TCU).

An airplane Pilot’s Operating Handbook (POH) is typically organized into nine standardized sections: General (basic specs), Limitations (operating boundaries), Emergency Procedures (checklist for failures), Normal Procedures (routine checklists), Performance (takeoff/climb data), Weight and Balance (loading limits), Airplane and Systems (technical descriptions), Handling and Maintenance (servicing), and Supplements (optional equipment info).

Large Cumulonimbus (CB) clouds and a rapid drop in temperature followed by gusting winds(microbursts) indicate heavy thunderstorm.

Heading is where the nose is pointed; Track is the actual path over the ground (Heading + Wind Drift = Track).

For logging night flight time, it is the period between evening civil twilight and morning civil twilight.

The primary transponder codes every pilot must know are 7500 for an aircraft hijacking, 7600 for a radio communications failure, and 7700 for any general emergency or distress situation.

Left hand pattern is standard.

Minimums for ATZ (AERODROME TRAFFICE ZONE) ia 1500 ceiling 5km visability. Managed by tower usually up to 2000. 5NM.

CTR (CONTROL ZONE) larger key shape protect Arrival/Dep Paths, often up to 2000-3000, C separate IFR or D only traffic information. 

TMA/TCA (TERMINAL CONTROL AREA) like Bangkok 50NM APP and DEP.

The Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate (3°C/1,000 ft) is the cooling rate of a rising unsaturated air parcel.

The Standard Lapse Rate (2°C/1,000 ft) is the average temperature decrease of the surrounding atmosphere used for altimetry.

The dew point is the temperature at which a parcel of air becomes fully saturated and can no longer hold its water vapor, causing it to condense into visible moisture like clouds, fog, or dew.

True Airspeed (TAS) is the actual speed of your aircraft relative to the air mass through which it is flying, calculated by correcting your indicated airspeed for non-standard temperature and pressure (altitude).

To estimate True Airspeed (TAS) in flight, simply add 2% to your indicated airspeed for every 1,000 feet of altitude above sea level.

Pressure Altitude is the height above the standard datum plane, which is the theoretical level where air pressure is exactly 1013.2 hPa.

Density Altitude is pressure altitude corrected for non-standard temperature, effectively representing the altitude at which the aircraft "feels" like it is performing based on the thickness of the air.

To calculate crosswind component, use the "Clock Method": a 15° wind angle is 1/4 of the total wind, 30° is 1/2, 45° is 3/4, and 60° or more is the full wind speed.

QNE uses the standard pressure of 1013.25 hPa to fly flight levels, QNH uses the local station pressure corrected to sea level (hPa) to show altitude above MSL, and QFE sets the airfield pressure (hPa) so the altimeter reads zero on the ground.

Transition Altitude is the fixed altitude during climb at which you switch your altimeter from local QNH to the standard 1013.2 hPa setting.

Transition Level is the lowest usable flight level during descent at which you switch from the standard setting back to the local QNH.

A narrow temperature-dew point spread of 2°C (3.6°F) or less, especially when paired with light winds, is the primary METAR indicator that fog is likely to form within the hour.

| Type of Fog | Primary Cause | Common Environment | Key Characteristics |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Radiation Fog** | Ground cooling at night | Inland valleys, clear calm nights | Forms at night; usually "burns off" after sunrise. |
| **Advection Fog** | Warm, moist air moving over a cold surface | Coastal areas (e.g., San Francisco) | Can occur day or night; often very thick and persistent. |
| **Upslope Fog** | Air cooling as it rises up terrain | Mountain slopes or high plains | Forms when wind pushes moist air uphill. |
| **Valley Fog** | Cold air settling in low points | Deep valleys and basins | Can last for days in winter due to temperature inversions. |
| **Steam Fog** | Cold air moving over warm water | Lakes in autumn; heated pools | Looks like "smoke" or steam rising from the surface. |
| **Frontal Fog** | Rain evaporating into cool air | Near warm or cold weather fronts | Occurs during or after rainfall as humidity hits 100%. |
