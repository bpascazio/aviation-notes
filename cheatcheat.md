**I'M SAFE Checklist:** (Self-Assessment before every flight)

* **I** - Illness / **M** - Medication
* **S** - Stress / **A** - Alcohol (8 hours "bottle to throttle" / 0.04% BAC)
* **F** - Fatigue / **E** - Emotion (or Eating/Hydration)

**PPL Privileges & Limits:**

* **Pro-Rata Share:** You **must** pay your equal share of fuel, oil, and airport fees.
* **Compensation:** $0.00 profit allowed.
* **Business:** Flying is allowed if it's "incidental" (e.g., flying yourself to a meeting, but not delivering parts for the company).
* **Charity:** Allowed under specific rules (91.146).

* **R** - Radio License (Required for international flight, e.g., flying in Thailand).
* **O** - Operating Limitations (POH / Placards).
* **W** - Weight & Balance (Current for your specific tail number).

**Required Inspections (AVIATES):**

* **A** - Annual (12 calendar months).
* **V** - VOR Check (30 days - IFR only).
* **I** - 100-Hour (If used for hire/instruction).
* **A** - Altimeter/Static (24 cal. months).
* **T** - Transponder (24 cal. months).

## 3. The V-Speed "Quick List" (BushCat Focus)

| Speed | Knots / MPH | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Vs0** | 38 kts / 43 mph | Stall speed (Landing config/Flaps down). |
| **Vs1** | 44 kts / 50 mph | Stall speed (Clean/Flaps up). |
| **Vx** | 49 kts / 56 mph | Best **Angle** of climb (Clear the trees). |
| **Vy** | 62 kts / 72 mph | Best **Rate** of climb (Most height per minute). |
| **Vg** | 56 kts / 64 mph | Best **Glide** (Engine out). |
| **Va** | 82 kts / 90 mph | Maneuvering speed (Changes with weight). |
| **Vno** | 82 kts / 90 mph | Max Structural Cruise (Top of green arc). |
| **Vne** | 108 kts / 125 mph | Never Exceed (Red line). |

## 4. Inoperative Equipment Flowchart

If something is broken on preflight:

1. **Is it in A-TOMATO-FLAMES (Day) or FLAPS (Night)?**
2. **Is it on the aircraft's KOEL (Kinds of Operation List)?**
3. **Is it required by an AD?**
4. **Is it required for the Type Certificate?** (Or Manufacturer's POH for SLSA).

**Action:** If "No" to all, you must **Deactivate** (turn off/pull breaker) and **Placard** ("INOP") the item. You then make a "Pilot's Decision" if the flight is still safe.

## 5. Weather Minimums (VFR)

* **Class B:** 3 SM Visibility, **Clear of Clouds**.
* **Class C/D/E (below 10,000'):** 3 SM Visibility, **500' below, 1,000' above, 2,000' horizontal** (3-152).
* **Class G (Day below 1,200' AGL):** 1 SM Visibility, **Clear of Clouds**.

## 6. Aerodynamics & Systems

* **Left Turning Tendencies:** Torque, P-Factor, Spiraling Slipstream, Gyroscopic Precession.
* **Stall/Spin Recovery:** **P.A.R.E.** (Power Idle, Ailerons Neutral, Rudder Opposite, Elevator Forward).
* **Engine:** BushCat uses the **Rotax 912** (Horizontally opposed, 4-cylinder, liquid-cooled heads, air-cooled cylinders, carbureted).
* **High Density Altitude:** Increases takeoff roll, decreases climb, increases true airspeed.

### Final Checkride Pro-Tip:

If you don't know the answer, **don't guess.** Say: *"I am not 100% certain of the specific number, but I know exactly where to find it in my POH / FAR-AIM."* Examiners value the ability to find correct information over memorizing everything.
