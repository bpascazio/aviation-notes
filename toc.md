### Checkride Strategy: The "Three-Step" Answer

When asked a question from any of these topics, try to answer in this order:

1. **Direct Answer:** State the number or regulation.
2. **Context:** Explain why it matters to your flight today.
3. **Reference:** Mention where you found it (POH, FAR/AIM, or Sectional Chart).

**Would you like me to expand on the "Required Inspections" (AVIATES) section specifically for CAAT or EASA rules?**
