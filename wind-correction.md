## 1. Wind Correction Angle (WCA)

The **Wind Correction Angle** is the number of degrees you must point the aircraft's nose into the wind to maintain your desired ground track.

### The Mental Formula

While you use an E6B flight computer during planning, you need a "quick-fire" method in the cockpit. A highly reliable rule of thumb is the **Max Drift** method:

1. **Find your Max Drift:** This is the maximum degrees you would drift if the wind were a direct 90° crosswind.
* **Formula:** 
* *Example:* If you fly at 120 knots (2 miles per minute) and the wind is 20 knots, your Max Drift is .


2. **Apply the Clock Face Rule:** Look at the angle between your course and the wind.
* **15° off:** Use 1/4 of Max Drift.
* **30° off:** Use 1/2 of Max Drift.
* **45° off:** Use 3/4 of Max Drift.
* **60°+ off:** Use Full Max Drift.

## 2. The "1-in-60" Rule

If you realize you are off course, the **1-in-60 Rule** is the gold standard for corrections. It states that **1 degree of error over 60 miles results in being 1 mile off course.**

### How to Calculate Your Error

If you have flown 30 miles and find yourself 2 miles off course:

1. **Determine the Angle Off:** Since you’ve only gone half of 60 miles (30 miles), each mile off counts for  instead of .
2. **Calculation:**  off course.

## 3. Getting Back on Course: Two Methods

Examiners in Thailand (CAAT) and EASA territories often look for specific "Lost Procedures" or "Off-Course Corrections."

### Method A: The Double Track Error (Fast Fix)

This is used if you are less than halfway to your destination and want to get back to your original line quickly.

* **Rule:** Double your track error and fly that heading for the same amount of time you’ve been off.
* **Example:** You are  left of track. Turn **right**  ( to parallel +  to intercept). Hold this for the same distance/time you were off, then turn back to your original heading +  for wind.

### Method B: The Opening/Closing Angle (The Standard)

Used when you want to fly straight to your next waypoint rather than returning to the original "line" on the map.

1. **Opening Angle:** How many degrees you drifted away from the start.
2. **Closing Angle:** How many degrees you need to "pinch" to hit the destination.
* **New Heading Correction = Opening Angle + Closing Angle**

## 4. Checkride "Golden Rules"

* **Identify the Drift:** Don't just steer aimlessly. Pick a landmark on your planned track. If it's moving to the right of your nose, you have a left crosswind.
* **Heading + Groundspeed = Success:** In Thailand, high humidity and heat significantly lower your TAS (True Airspeed). Always re-calculate your groundspeed at your first checkpoint to ensure your ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival) is still valid.
* **Don't "Chase the Needle":** If using VOR/NDB, make a correction ( to ), hold it, and observe. Small, deliberate changes impress examiners more than erratic zig-zagging.

During a PPL checkride, the examiner will likely ask you to calculate your crosswind component while you are on the downwind or base leg. Relying solely on a chart in the POH is difficult while flying the airplane.

Here is an update to your study guide focusing on "cockpit math" for crosswind components, applicable for FAA, EASA, and CAAT standards.

## 1. The Clock Face Rule (The Standard Method)

This is the most common rule of thumb taught globally. It uses the minutes on a clock to represent the angle of the wind relative to the runway.

Imagine the runway heading is at the top of the clock (12 o'clock). Determine how many degrees the wind is "off" the runway centerline:

* **15° off:** Use **1/4** of the total wind speed as crosswind. (15 mins is 1/4 of an hour).
* **30° off:** Use **1/2** of the total wind speed as crosswind. (30 mins is 1/2 of an hour).
* **45° off:** Use **3/4** of the total wind speed as crosswind. (45 mins is 3/4 of an hour).
* **60°+ off:** Use **Full** wind speed as crosswind.

> **Example:** You are landing on Runway 36 (North). The tower reports wind from 030 at 20 knots.
> * The angle is 30° off.
> * Calculation:  crosswind.

## 2. The "Rule of Sixths" (More Precise)

For EASA or CAAT exams, where precision is often emphasized, some instructors prefer the **Rule of Sixths**. It is slightly more conservative than the clock face rule:

| Angle off Runway | Multiplier (Sixths) | Decimal Approx. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **10°** | 1/6 | ~0.17 |
| **20°** | 2/6 (1/3) | ~0.33 |
| **30°** | 3/6 (1/2) | 0.50 |
| **40°** | 4/6 (2/3) | ~0.66 |
| **50°** | 5/6 | ~0.83 |
| **60°+** | 6/6 (Full) | 1.00 |

## 3. The "Max Crosswind" Strategy

During your oral exam, the examiner will ask: **"What is the maximum demonstrated crosswind for this aircraft?"**

* **Fact:** This is *not* a limitation for most light GA aircraft (like a Cessna 172), but rather a "demonstrated" value by a test pilot.
* **Checkride Tip:** Even if the POH says 15 knots, you should state your **personal minimums**. A common answer is: *"The aircraft is demonstrated to 15 knots, but as a student/new PPL, my personal limit is 10 knots."*

## 4. Headwind vs. Crosswind (The 5-7-9 Rule)

If you need to know how much **headwind** you are keeping (to calculate your landing distance from the previous article), use this quick guide for the *Cosine* of the angle:

* **30° off:** You keep **90%** of the wind as headwind.
* **45° off:** You keep **70%** of the wind as headwind.
* **60° off:** You keep **50%** of the wind as headwind.

## 5. Thailand (CAAT) Specific Considerations

In Thailand, winds are often light, but **convective activity (afternoon thunderstorms)** can cause sudden gusts and "wind shifts."

* **The "Gust" Factor:** If the wind is 10 knots gusting 20, always use the **high number (20)** for your crosswind calculation to be safe.
* **Density Altitude:** Remember that in the Thai heat, your groundspeed on touchdown will be higher than in cooler climates. A crosswind will "push" a faster-moving airplane more aggressively during the rollout.
