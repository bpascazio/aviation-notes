## Hypoxia

### What is Hypoxia?

**Definition**: A state of oxygen deficiency in the body, tissues, or blood sufficient to cause impairment of function.

**Types of Hypoxia**:
1. **Hypoxic Hypoxia**: Insufficient oxygen in the air (altitude)
2. **Hypemic Hypoxia**: Insufficient oxygen-carrying capacity of blood (anemia, carbon monoxide)
3. **Stagnant Hypoxia**: Insufficient blood circulation (G-forces, shock)
4. **Histotoxic Hypoxia**: Cells cannot use oxygen (alcohol, drugs)

### Hypoxia Onset

#### Altitude and Symptoms

**Sea Level to 5,000 Feet MSL**:
- **No significant effects** for most people
- **Some individuals** may notice slight effects

**5,000 to 10,000 Feet MSL**:
- **Mild symptoms** may appear
- **Decreased night vision** (begins around 5,000 feet)
- **Slight decrease** in performance
- **Most people** function normally

**10,000 to 15,000 Feet MSL**:
- **Moderate symptoms** appear
- **Decreased judgment** and decision-making
- **Decreased coordination**
- **Fatigue** and drowsiness
- **Headache** may occur
- **Performance significantly degraded**

**15,000 to 20,000 Feet MSL**:
- **Severe symptoms**
- **Loss of consciousness** possible
- **Severe impairment** of judgment and coordination
- **Cyanosis** (blue lips/fingernails)
- **Time of useful consciousness** decreases rapidly

**Above 20,000 Feet MSL**:
- **Time of useful consciousness** very short (minutes or seconds)
- **Loss of consciousness** likely
- **Death** possible without oxygen

### Hypoxia Symptoms and Indications

#### Early Symptoms (Mild Hypoxia)
- **Euphoria** - feeling of well-being
- **Decreased night vision** - begins around 5,000 feet
- **Headache** - mild to moderate
- **Fatigue** - feeling tired
- **Drowsiness** - feeling sleepy
- **Decreased judgment** - poor decision-making
- **Decreased coordination** - clumsiness

#### Moderate Symptoms
- **Cyanosis** - blue lips, fingernails, skin
- **Tingling** - in fingers and toes
- **Numbness** - in extremities
- **Visual impairment** - tunnel vision, blurred vision
- **Hearing impairment** - ringing in ears
- **Decreased reaction time** - slower responses
- **Impaired thinking** - difficulty concentrating

#### Severe Symptoms
- **Loss of consciousness** - fainting
- **Convulsions** - seizures
- **Death** - if not treated

### Time of Useful Consciousness (TUC)

**Definition**: The time a person can perform useful functions at altitude without supplemental oxygen.

**Typical TUC**:
- **25,000 feet**: 3-5 minutes
- **30,000 feet**: 1-2 minutes
- **35,000 feet**: 30-60 seconds
- **40,000 feet**: 15-30 seconds

**Factors Affecting TUC**:
- **Physical fitness** - fitter individuals may have longer TUC
- **Activity level** - more activity decreases TUC
- **Individual variation** - varies significantly between people
- **Previous exposure** - may affect tolerance

### Hypoxia Prevention

**Prevention Techniques**:
1. **Use supplemental oxygen** when required
2. **Descend** to lower altitude if symptoms occur
3. **Recognize symptoms** early
4. **Avoid alcohol** before flight (increases hypoxia effects)
5. **Stay hydrated** - dehydration increases hypoxia effects
6. **Avoid smoking** - carbon monoxide reduces oxygen-carrying capacity
7. **Get adequate rest** - fatigue increases hypoxia effects
8. **Know your limits** - individual tolerance varies

## Effects of Alcohol on Hypoxia

### Alcohol and Hypoxia Interaction

**Alcohol Effects**:
- **Depresses central nervous system**
- **Increases hypoxia effects** - alcohol makes hypoxia worse
- **Decreases judgment** - poor decision-making
- **Decreases coordination** - impaired motor skills
- **Decreases reaction time** - slower responses
- **Impairs vision** - especially night vision
- **Increases fatigue** - makes you tired

**Hypoxia Effects Enhanced by Alcohol**:
- **Lower altitude** for symptoms to appear
- **More severe symptoms** at same altitude
- **Faster onset** of symptoms
- **Longer recovery time**
- **Increased risk** of loss of consciousness

### Alcohol Regulations

### Alcohol and Hypoxia Combined Effects

**Combined Effects**:
- **Lower altitude** for hypoxia symptoms (may appear at 5,000-8,000 feet instead of 10,000+ feet)
- **More severe symptoms** at same altitude
- **Faster onset** of symptoms
- **Longer recovery time** after descent
- **Increased risk** of loss of consciousness

**Best Practice**:
- **No alcohol** before flight (recommended 24 hours)
- **Recognize** that alcohol effects persist longer at altitude
- **Be conservative** - if you drank, don't fly
