## 1. Core Privileges (What You CAN Do)

Across **FAA**, **EASA**, and **CAAT**, a PPL holder may:

* **Act as Pilot-In-Command (PIC)** of an aircraft carrying passengers.
* **Share Operating Expenses:** You can share the "pro-rata" (equal share) cost of a flight with your passengers. This includes fuel, oil, airport expenditures, and rental fees.
* **Fly for Business:** You can fly yourself to a business meeting (incidental to the business) as long as the aircraft is not carrying passengers or property for hire.
* **Charity/Non-Profit:** Act as PIC for charitable, non-profit, or community events (subject to specific regional regulations).

## 2. Fundamental Limits (What You CANNOT Do)

* **No Profit:** You cannot fly for "compensation or hire." This means you cannot make a single cent of profit from a flight.
* **No "Holding Out":** You cannot advertise your services to the public to fly them from point A to point B.
* **Passenger Numbers:** You are generally limited by the aircraft's seating capacity and weight limits, not a specific "PPL passenger cap" (unlike the Recreational Pilot or Sport Pilot certificates).

## 3. Regional Nuances (The "Oral Exam" Gotchas)

### FAA (United States) - 14 CFR 61.113

* **Pro-Rata Share:** You **must** pay your equal share. If there are 3 people on board (you + 2 friends), you must pay at least 1/3 of the costs. You cannot let them pay for the whole flight.
* **Sales Demonstrations:** If you are an aircraft salesman with at least 200 hours, you may demonstrate an aircraft to a prospective buyer.
* **Towing:** You can tow a glider if you meet the requirements of 61.69.

### EASA (Europe) - Part-FCL.205.A

* **Cost Sharing:** EASA is slightly more relaxed. For "introductory flights" or "cost-shared flights," the rule allows for the direct costs to be shared by all occupants, **including the pilot**, but there is no strict "pro-rata" math requirement like in the US—provided the flight is not advertised as a commercial operation.
* **LAPL vs PPL:** Be careful not to confuse PPL privileges with the Light Aircraft Pilot License (LAPL), which limits you to 4 persons on board and 2,000kg MTOM.

### CAAT (Thailand) - PEL Regulation

* **Strictly Non-Commercial:** CAAT follows ICAO Annex 1 standards closely. There is very little "grey area" for charity or specialized operations compared to the FAA.
* **Language Proficiency:** To exercise privileges in Thailand, you must have an ICAO English Language Proficiency (ELP) of **Level 4 or higher** on your license.

## 4. Endorsements & Ratings

A PPL is a "license to learn." To fly certain types of aircraft, you need specific logbook endorsements from a Flight Instructor (CFI).

| Endorsement | Requirement | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **High Performance** | > 200 Horsepower | For aircraft like a Cessna 182 or Cirrus SR22. |
| **Complex** | Retractable Gear + Flaps + Constant Speed Prop | For aircraft like a Piper Arrow or Beechcraft Bonanza. |
| **Tailwheel** | No "Nose Wheel" | Required for conventional gear aircraft (Citabria, Cub). |
| **High Altitude** | Service Ceiling > 25,000' MSL | Requires training on pressurized systems and hypoxia. |

## 5. Requirements to Remain "Current"

To keep your privileges active, you must meet these "Recency of Experience" rules:

1. **Flight Review (FAA/CAAT) or Training Flight (EASA):** Every **24 calendar months**, you must complete a review with an instructor to keep your license "active."
2. **Passenger Currency:** To carry passengers, you must have done **3 takeoffs and 3 landings** in the same category/class within the preceding **90 days**.
3. **Night Currency:** If carrying passengers at night, those 3 landings must be to a **full stop** at night.
4. **Medical Certificate:** You must hold a valid medical certificate (usually Class 2 for PPL). If your medical expires, your license privileges are "grounded" until renewed.

## 6. Document Checklist (The "Is it Legal?" Test)

Before every flight, ensure you have:

* **P** - Pilot Certificate (License).
* **M** - Medical Certificate.
* **P** - Photo ID (Passport or Driver's License).
* **L** - Logbook (only if flying on an endorsement or as a student).

**Would you like me to create a "Scenario Quiz" where I give you a flight situation and you tell me if it's legal under PPL privileges?**
