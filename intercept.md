For both the EASA (Europe) and CAAT (Thailand) PPL exams, interception procedures follow the **ICAO Annex 2** international standards. These visual signals are universal and vital for air law exams.

### 1. Mandatory Actions for Intercepted Aircraft

If you are intercepted, you must immediately:

1. **Follow all visual signals** from the interceptor.
2. **Squawk 7700** on your transponder.
3. **Monitor 121.500 MHz** (Guard) and attempt to establish radio contact.
4. **Notify ATC** (if possible).

### 2. Signals from Interceptor (Fighter) to You

These are commands you must obey. Note that "Night" signals usually just add lights to the "Day" maneuver.

| Signal Number | Interceptor Action (Day/Night) | Meaning | Your Required Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Series 1** | Rock wings from front-left. **Night:** Same + irregular light flashes. | **You are intercepted. Follow me.** | Rock wings and follow. |
| **Series 2** | Abrupt breakaway (90° climbing turn) without crossing your path. | **You may proceed.** | Rock wings to acknowledge. |
| **Series 3** | Circles airport, lowers gear, overflies runway. **Night:** Steady landing lights. | **Land at this aerodrome.** | Lower gear, follow, and land. |

### 3. Signals from You to the Interceptor

Use these if you are in trouble or cannot follow their instructions.

| Your Action (Day/Night) | Meaning | Interceptor’s Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Raise landing gear** & flash landing lights while overflying the runway. | **This aerodrome is inadequate** (too short, etc.). | Interceptor uses **Series 1** to lead you elsewhere or **Series 2** to release you. |
| **Regular** switching ON/OFF all available lights (distinct from flashing). | **Cannot comply** (mechanical failure, etc.). | Interceptor uses **Series 2** (Proceed). |
| **Irregular** flashing of all available lights. | **In Distress** (Emergency). | Interceptor uses **Series 2** (Proceed). |

### 4. Emergency Radio Phraseology

If you make radio contact on 121.5 MHz, use these standard ICAO phrases. Repeat each phrase **twice**.

| Situation | Phrase to Say | Pronunciation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Understood / Will comply | **WILCO** | VILL-KOH |
| Cannot comply | **CAN NOT** | KANN NOTT |
| You are in trouble | **MAYDAY** | MAY-DAY |
| You are hijacked | **HIJACK** | HI-JACK |
| My callsign is... | **CALLSIGN** | KOL-SA-IN |

### Study Tip for the Oral Exam

Examiners in Thailand and Europe love to ask: *"What do you do if radio instructions conflict with visual signals?"*

* **The Answer:** Always continue to follow the **visual signals** while requesting clarification via radio. Visual signals from a fighter jet right next to your wing take priority for safety.
