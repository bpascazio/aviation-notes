# PPL V-Speed Training Guide (FAA / EASA / CAAT)

## 1. The Airspeed Indicator (ASI) Markings

These are your "visual" speeds found on the face of the instrument.

* **White Arc (Vso to Vfe):** Flap operating range.
* **Green Arc (Vs1 to Vno):** Normal operating range.
* **Yellow Arc (Vno to Vne):** Caution range (smooth air only).
* **Red Line (Vne):** Never exceed speed.

## 2. Performance & Maneuvering Speeds

These speeds are specific to your aircraft POH (Pilot's Operating Handbook).

| Speed | Name | Definition & Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Vr** | Rotation Speed | Speed to lift the nose wheel for takeoff. |
| **Vx** | Best Angle of Climb | Most altitude over **distance** (to clear trees/obstacles). |
| **Vy** | Best Rate of Climb | Most altitude over **time** (normal en-route climb). |
| **Vg** | Best Glide Speed | Best lift-to-drag ratio; used during engine failure. |
| **Va** | Maneuvering Speed | Max speed for abrupt control inputs; changes with weight. |

## 3. Stall & Limitation Speeds

Crucial for landing and structural safety.

* **Vso:** Stall speed in landing configuration (flaps down). Think: "Stuff Out."
* **Vs1:** Stall speed in a clean configuration (flaps up).
* **Vfe:** Maximum flap extended speed. (Don't deploy flaps above this!)
* **Vno:** Maximum structural cruising speed (top of the green arc).
* **Vne:** Never exceed speed (the red line).

## 4. Checkride "Oral Exam" Tips

When the examiner asks about these speeds, use these professional definitions:

* **For Va (Maneuvering Speed):** "Va decreases as weight decreases. A lighter airplane is more susceptible to rapid acceleration from gusts, so I must fly slower to ensure the wing stalls before the airframe suffers structural damage."
* **For Vg (Best Glide):** "This speed provides the most distance for the least altitude lost. If I fly faster or slower than Vg, my glide range will decrease."
* **For CAAT/EASA Exams:** Be prepared to discuss **Vat** (Speed at Threshold), which is typically .
* **For Tropical Climates (Thailand):** Mention how **High Density Altitude** doesn't change your *Indicated* V-speeds, but it will increase your *Ground Speed* and decrease your climb performance.
