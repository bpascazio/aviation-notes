## The Four Forces of Flight

### Lift
- **Definition**: Force that opposes weight and supports the aircraft in flight
- **Direction**: Acts perpendicular to the relative wind
- **Generated by**: Airfoil (wing) moving through air
- **Factors affecting**: Airspeed, angle of attack, air density, wing area, coefficient of lift

### Weight
- **Definition**: Force of gravity acting on the aircraft
- **Direction**: Acts vertically downward
- **Components**: Empty weight, fuel, passengers, baggage, cargo
- **Effect**: Must be overcome by lift for flight

### Thrust
- **Definition**: Force that propels the aircraft forward
- **Direction**: Acts parallel to the longitudinal axis
- **Generated by**: Propeller or jet engine
- **Effect**: Overcomes drag to maintain or increase airspeed

### Drag
- **Definition**: Force that opposes thrust
- **Direction**: Acts parallel and opposite to the direction of flight
- **Types**: 
  - **Parasite drag**: Form drag, interference drag, skin friction
  - **Induced drag**: Created by lift (increases with angle of attack)

## Angle of Attack

### Definition
- **Angle of Attack (AOA)**: Angle between the chord line of the wing and the relative wind
- **Critical Angle of Attack**: Angle at which stall occurs (typically 15-20 degrees)
- **Not the same as**: Pitch attitude or flight path angle

### Importance
- **Stall occurs at critical angle of attack**, not at a specific airspeed
- **Can stall at any airspeed** if critical angle of attack is exceeded
- **Primary factor in stall**, not airspeed alone

### Factors Affecting Critical Angle of Attack
- **Wing design**: Airfoil shape
- **Flaps**: Lower critical angle of attack when extended
- **Weight**: Does not change critical angle of attack
- **Load factor**: Increases stall speed but not critical angle of attack

## Stalls

### What is a Stall?

**Definition**: A stall occurs when the angle of attack exceeds the critical angle of attack, causing a loss of lift.

**Key Points**:
- Stall occurs at **critical angle of attack**, not at a specific airspeed
- Can occur at **any airspeed** if critical angle of attack is exceeded
- Can occur in **any attitude** (level flight, climb, turn, descent)
- **Not caused by engine failure** (though engine failure can lead to stall)

### Stall Characteristics

**Warning Signs**:
- **Buffeting**: Airflow separation causes vibration
- **Control sloppiness**: Controls become less effective
- **Stall warning horn/light**: Activates before stall
- **High angle of attack**: Nose high attitude

**Stall Symptoms**:
- **Loss of lift**: Wing no longer produces sufficient lift
- **Nose drop**: Aircraft pitches down
- **Control effectiveness reduced**: Controls become less responsive
- **Possible wing drop**: One wing may stall before the other

### Stall Recovery

**Standard Recovery Procedure**:
1. **Reduce angle of attack** (push forward on control column/yoke)
2. **Apply full power** (if available)
3. **Level wings** (use ailerons to level if wing dropped)
4. **Return to level flight** (elevator to level attitude)
5. **Resume normal flight**

**Key Points**:
- **Primary action**: Reduce angle of attack immediately
- **Do not pull back**: Pulling back increases angle of attack and worsens stall
- **Power helps**: But reducing angle of attack is most important
- **Recovery altitude**: Must have sufficient altitude for recovery

### Types of Stalls

#### Power-On Stall
- **Characteristics**: 
  - Occurs with power applied
  - More pronounced nose drop
  - Higher stall speed
  - More aggressive break
- **Recovery**: Same procedure - reduce angle of attack first

#### Power-Off Stall
- **Characteristics**:
  - Occurs with power idle
  - More gentle break
  - Lower stall speed
  - Less aggressive
- **Recovery**: Same procedure - reduce angle of attack first

#### Accelerated Stall
- **Definition**: Stall that occurs during maneuvering (turns, pull-ups)
- **Characteristics**:
  - Occurs at higher airspeed due to increased load factor
  - Can occur during steep turns, pull-ups, or abrupt maneuvers
  - More dangerous due to higher energy
- **Recovery**: Reduce angle of attack, level wings, apply power

#### Cross-Control Stall
- **Definition**: Stall that occurs with crossed controls (uncoordinated flight)
- **Characteristics**:
  - Very dangerous
  - Can lead to spin
  - Often occurs during base-to-final turn
- **Prevention**: Maintain coordinated flight, avoid skidding turns

### Minimum Altitude for Stall Training

#### FAA Requirements
- **Minimum altitude**: **1,500 feet AGL** (Above Ground Level)
- **Regulation**: FAR Part 61.107 (PPL training requirements)
- **Purpose**: Ensure adequate altitude for recovery
- **Note**: Must maintain minimum altitude during all stall practice

#### EASA Requirements
- **Minimum altitude**: **1,500 feet AGL** (Above Ground Level)
- **Regulation**: EU Regulation 965/2012 (Part-FCL)
- **Purpose**: Ensure adequate altitude for recovery
- **Note**: Must maintain minimum altitude during all stall practice

#### Thailand CAAT Requirements
- **Minimum altitude**: **1,500 feet AGL** (Above Ground Level)
- **Regulation**: CAAT regulations (following ICAO standards)
- **Purpose**: Ensure adequate altitude for recovery
- **Note**: Must maintain minimum altitude during all stall practice

**Common Requirements**:
- All three regulatory systems require **1,500 feet AGL minimum** for stall training
- This provides adequate altitude for recovery
- Must not descend below this altitude during practice
- Recovery must be initiated immediately upon stall

## Spins

### What is a Spin?

**Definition**: A spin is an aggravated stall that results in autorotation (uncontrolled rotation) about the vertical axis.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Autorotation**: Aircraft rotates around vertical axis
- **Stalled condition**: One or both wings are stalled
- **Uncontrolled descent**: Descending in a corkscrew path
- **High rate of descent**: Can exceed 5,000 feet per minute
- **Rapid altitude loss**: Loses altitude quickly

### Spin Phases

#### Entry
- **Stall occurs**: Aircraft reaches critical angle of attack
- **Yaw introduced**: Uncoordinated flight or wing drop causes yaw
- **Autorotation begins**: Aircraft starts rotating

#### Developed Spin
- **Fully developed rotation**: Steady rotation rate
- **High rate of descent**: Rapidly losing altitude
- **Stalled condition maintained**: Wings remain stalled
- **Stable rotation**: Rotation continues until recovery action taken

#### Recovery
- **Recovery action**: Pilot applies recovery procedure
- **Rotation stops**: Autorotation ceases
- **Stall recovery**: Aircraft recovers from stall
- **Return to normal flight**: Resume controlled flight

### Spin Recovery Procedure

**Standard Recovery (PARE)**:
1. **Power**: Idle (reduce power to idle)
2. **Ailerons**: Neutral (center ailerons)
3. **Rudder**: Opposite to spin direction (full opposite rudder)
4. **Elevator**: Forward (push forward to break stall)

**Alternative Recovery (FAA)**:
1. **Power**: Idle
2. **Ailerons**: Neutral
3. **Rudder**: Full opposite to spin direction
4. **Elevator**: Forward (break stall)

**Key Points**:
- **Opposite rudder is primary**: Most important control input
- **Break the stall**: Forward elevator reduces angle of attack
- **Neutral ailerons**: Ailerons can worsen spin if used incorrectly
- **Power idle**: Reduces gyroscopic effects
- **Recovery takes altitude**: May lose 1,000-2,000 feet during recovery

### Types of Spins

#### Normal Spin
- **Entry**: From coordinated stall with yaw
- **Characteristics**: Steady rotation, predictable recovery
- **Recovery**: Standard PARE procedure

#### Flat Spin
- **Entry**: Extreme aft CG or improper recovery attempt
- **Characteristics**: 
  - Very flat attitude
  - High rate of rotation
  - Difficult to recover
  - May be unrecoverable
- **Recovery**: Very difficult, may require special techniques

#### Inverted Spin
- **Entry**: From inverted flight or aerobatic maneuvers
- **Characteristics**: 
  - Aircraft inverted during spin
  - Different recovery procedure
  - Requires aerobatic training
- **Recovery**: Specialized procedure (not covered in PPL)

### Minimum Altitude for Spin Training

- **Maintain coordinated flight**: Avoid uncoordinated flight
- **Avoid cross-control situations**: Especially in base-to-final turn
- **Recognize stall warning**: Respond to stall warning immediately
- **Proper stall recovery**: Correct recovery prevents spin entry

## Load Factors

### Definition
- **Load Factor (G-force)**: Ratio of total lift to aircraft weight
- **1 G**: Normal flight (lift equals weight)
- **2 G**: Load factor of 2 (lift is twice the weight)
- **0 G**: Weightless condition

### Load Factor in Turns
- **Steeper turn = higher load factor**
- **60° bank**: 2 G load factor
- **45° bank**: 1.41 G load factor
- **30° bank**: 1.15 G load factor

### Effect on Stall Speed
- **Stall speed increases with load factor**
- **Formula**: New Stall Speed = √(Load Factor) × Normal Stall Speed
- **Example**: At 2 G, stall speed increases by 41%
- **At 4 G**: Stall speed doubles

### Structural Limits
- **Normal category**: +3.8 G, -1.52 G
- **Utility category**: +4.4 G, -1.76 G
- **Acrobatic category**: +6.0 G, -3.0 G
- **Never exceed**: Structural damage or failure may occur

## Stability

### Longitudinal Stability
- **Definition**: Stability around lateral axis (pitch)
- **Positive stability**: Returns to original attitude after disturbance
- **CG position**: Forward CG increases stability, aft CG decreases stability
- **Wing position**: High wing vs. low wing affects stability

### Lateral Stability
- **Definition**: Stability around longitudinal axis (roll)
- **Dihedral**: Upward angle of wings increases lateral stability
- **Sweepback**: Swept wings increase lateral stability
- **Keel effect**: Vertical surfaces provide stability

### Directional Stability
- **Definition**: Stability around vertical axis (yaw)
- **Vertical stabilizer**: Provides directional stability
- **Weathervane effect**: Aircraft tends to align with relative wind

## Common Oral Exam Questions

### Stalls

**Q: What is a stall?**

A: A stall occurs when the angle of attack exceeds the critical angle of attack, causing a loss of lift. It can occur at any airspeed if the critical angle of attack is exceeded.

**Q: What causes a stall?**

A: Exceeding the critical angle of attack causes a stall. This can happen at any airspeed, in any attitude, and is not caused by engine failure (though engine failure can lead to a stall).

**Q: What is the stall recovery procedure?**

A: 
1. Reduce angle of attack (push forward)
2. Apply full power (if available)
3. Level wings (if wing dropped)
4. Return to level flight
5. Resume normal flight

**Q: What is the minimum altitude for stall practice?**

A: 1,500 feet AGL for all regulatory systems (FAA, EASA, Thailand CAAT).

**Q: Can you stall at any airspeed?**

A: Yes, a stall occurs at critical angle of attack, not at a specific airspeed. You can stall at high speed if you exceed the critical angle of attack.

### Spins

**Q: What is a spin?**

A: A spin is an aggravated stall that results in autorotation about the vertical axis, causing uncontrolled descent in a corkscrew path.

**Q: What is the spin recovery procedure?**

A: PARE procedure:
1. Power: Idle
2. Ailerons: Neutral
3. Rudder: Full opposite to spin direction
4. Elevator: Forward (break stall)

**Q: Is spin training required for PPL?**

A: No, spin training is not required for PPL in FAA, EASA, or Thailand CAAT. However, spin awareness training is recommended.

**Q: What is the minimum altitude for spin training?**

A: 1,500 feet AGL if spin training is conducted (FAA, EASA, Thailand CAAT).

**Q: How much altitude do you lose in a spin recovery?**

A: Typically 1,000-2,000 feet, which is why minimum altitude requirements exist.

**Q: What causes a spin?**

A: A spin is caused by a stall combined with yaw (uncoordinated flight). Cross-control situations, especially in turns, can lead to spins.

### Angle of Attack

**Q: What is angle of attack?**

A: Angle of attack is the angle between the chord line of the wing and the relative wind. It is the primary factor in stall, not airspeed.

**Q: Does weight affect the critical angle of attack?**

A: No, weight does not change the critical angle of attack. However, weight does affect stall speed (heavier aircraft stall at higher speeds).

### Load Factors

**Q: What is load factor?**

A: Load factor is the ratio of total lift to aircraft weight, expressed in G-forces. 1 G is normal flight, 2 G means lift is twice the weight.

**Q: How does load factor affect stall speed?**

A: Stall speed increases with the square root of load factor. At 2 G, stall speed increases by 41%. At 4 G, stall speed doubles.

**Q: What is the load factor in a 60° bank turn?**

A: 2 G. The formula is: Load Factor = 1 ÷ cos(bank angle).
