The Cessna 210 Centurion is a cornerstone of high-performance general aviation. Over its 26-year production run (1960–1986), it evolved from what was essentially a retractable-gear Cessna 182 into a sophisticated, six-seat, pressurized cross-country machine.

Below is a comprehensive breakdown of the major production changes by model letter.

### Critical Knowledge for PPL/CPL Candidates

If you are planning to fly or take a checkride in a 210, keep these three system evolutions in mind:

* **The Wing:** 1960–1966 models have **struts**; 1967–1986 models are **cantilever** (strutless).
* **The Landing Gear:** Early models have "flat plate" gear legs. 1970 (K model) and later have the **tubular steel** gear, which allowed for a larger rear cabin.
* **The Gear Doors:** If you see a 210 without main gear doors, it is likely an **N or R model** (or an earlier model with a "gear door removal" STC), which was done to reduce maintenance complexity.

## Pilot Study Guide: Cessna 210L Centurion V-Speeds

The **Cessna 210L**, produced between 1972 and 1976, is a high-performance, complex aircraft. For the PPL or Commercial oral exam, you are expected to know these speeds by heart. Because the 210L was produced during the industry's transition from Imperial to Metric units, you must be familiar with both **Knots (KIAS)** and **Miles Per Hour (MPH)**.

The following speeds are based on the standard Maximum Takeoff Weight (MTOW) of **3,800 lbs**.

---

### The V-Speed Reference Table (3,800 lbs)

| V-Speed | Definition | Knots (KIAS) | MPH (MIAS) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Vso** | Stall Speed (Landing configuration / Full Flaps) | **54** | **62** |
| **Vs1** | Stall Speed (Clean configuration / Flaps Up) | **63** | **72** |
| **Vr** | Rotation Speed | **65** | **75** |
| **Vx** | Best Angle of Climb (Clearing obstacles) | **70** | **81** |
| **Vy** | Best Rate of Climb (Gain altitude fastest) | **88** | **101** |
| **Va** | Maneuvering Speed (At 3,800 lbs) | **125** | **144** |
| **Vfe (10°)** | Max Flap Extension Speed (First Notch) | **140** | **161** |
| **Vfe (Full)** | Max Flap Extension Speed (10° to 30°) | **105** | **121** |
| **Vlo (Ext)** | Max Gear Operating Speed (Extension) | **140** | **161** |

| **Vno** | Max Structural Cruising Speed (Yellow Arc) | **165** | **190** |
| **Vne** | Never Exceed Speed (Red Line) | **195** | **224** |
| **Vglide** | Best Glide Speed (At 3,800 lbs) | **80** | **92** |
| **Vref** | Final Approach Speed (Full Flaps) | **75** | **86** |

### Key Operational Discussion Points for Oral Exams

#### 1. The "105 Knot" Rule

Notice that **105 KIAS** is a critical number for the 210L. It is the maximum speed for both **Gear Retraction** and **Full Flap Extension**. Remembering this single "configuration speed" helps reduce pilot workload during the high-stress departure phase.

#### 2. Gear Extension vs. Retraction

A common examiner question is: *"Why is the Gear Extension speed (140) higher than the Retraction speed (105)?"*

* **Answer:** During retraction, the hydraulic system must fight the relative wind to pull the gear and the gear doors *into* the wells. During extension, gravity assists the process, and the mechanical loads on the gear doors are more favorable.

#### 3. Maneuvering Speed (Va) and Weight

The  listed above (**125 KIAS**) is only valid at the maximum weight of 3,800 lbs.

* **Rule of Thumb:** As the aircraft gets lighter,  **decreases**. If you are flying a 210L with only two people and low fuel, your  could be as low as **110 KIAS**.

#### 4. The Power of the First 10° of Flaps

The 210L is a very "clean" airplane and can be difficult to slow down. Cessna designed the first 10° of flaps to be deployed at **140 KIAS** (). This allows the pilot to use the flaps as an aerodynamic brake to help slow the aircraft down to the landing gear extension speed.

---

### Checkride Tip

When an examiner asks for a V-speed, always state the unit (Knots or MPH) clearly. If you are flying in **Thailand (CAAT)**, you will likely be given wind in Knots, so being fluent in the Knots column is essential for situational awareness.

Performing short-field operations in a heavy, high-performance aircraft like the **Cessna 210L** requires precise airspeed control and configuration management. Because the 210 has a heavy nose and a powerful engine, "pitch for airspeed, power for altitude" is the golden rule.

---

## 1. Short-Field Takeoff (Cessna 210L)

The goal is to get the aircraft off the ground in the shortest distance and climb at the steepest angle to clear a 50-foot obstacle.

**Configuration:**

* **Flaps:** 10°
* **Trim:** Set for Takeoff
* **Cowls Flaps:** Open

**Procedure:**

1. **Taxi:** Use all available runway. Line up on the numbers.
2. **Brakes:** Hold firmly.
3. **Throttle:** Smoothly apply **Full Power**. Check gauges (Green arc) and RPM (2850 max).
4. **Brakes:** Release only after full power is verified.
5. **Pitch:** Rotate at **65 KIAS (75 MPH)**.
6. **Climb:** Maintain **70 KIAS (81 MPH)** () until all obstacles are cleared.
7. **Gear:** Retract once a "positive rate of climb" is established and you can no longer land back on the remaining runway. (Note:  retraction is 105 KIAS).
8. **Flaps:** Retract slowly after clearing obstacles and accelerating past **80 KIAS**.

---

## 2. Short-Field Landing (Cessna 210L)

The goal is to clear a 50-foot obstacle and stop the aircraft in the shortest possible distance with a specific touchdown point.

**Configuration:**

* **Flaps:** 30° (Full)
* **Propeller:** High RPM (Full Forward)
* **Gear:** Down & Locked (Check "Three Green")

**Procedure:**

1. **Approach:** Fly a slightly wider-than-normal pattern to allow time for the heavy aircraft to stabilize.
2. **Final Approach:** On short final, maintain **75 KIAS (86 MPH)** ().
3. **Obstacle Clearance:** If a 50-foot obstacle exists, maintain  until cleared.
4. **Power:** Gradually reduce power once the landing is assured. Do not "chop" the power too high, or the 210 will sink rapidly due to its high wing loading.
5. **Touchdown:** Target the "Aiming Point." The 210L should touch down at the lowest possible airspeed (approx. **55-60 KIAS**).
6. **Flaps:** Retract immediately after touchdown. This shifts weight from the wings to the wheels for better braking.
7. **Braking:** Apply heavy, steady pressure without skidding the tires.

### Checkride "Oral" Trap: The Tail Strike

The 210 is a long aircraft. When practicing short-field landings, students often try to "stall" the airplane onto the runway. An examiner will watch for an excessive flare.

* **Safety Tip:** If you flare too aggressively, the "tie-down" ring or the tail cone can strike the pavement. Aim for a firm, nose-high attitude, but do not drag the tail.

### Rule of Thumb for Performance

If you are at **VTBU (U-Tapao)** on a hot 35°C day, your takeoff roll will increase by approximately **10% for every 10°F above standard temperature**. Always check your POH performance charts before attempting a short-field takeoff in the Thai heat.

This guide covers critical emergency procedures for the **Cessna 210L** (3,800 lbs MTOW), specifically tailored for a checkride environment and the unique challenges of flying over the Gulf of Thailand.

## 1. Engine Failure After Takeoff (EFATO)

If the engine fails shortly after takeoff, your primary goal is to maintain control and land straight ahead. **Do not attempt to turn back to the runway** unless you have sufficient altitude (typically 1,000 ft AGL for a 210L).

### Immediate Action Steps

1. **Airspeed:** Pitch for **80 KIAS** (92 MPH). Do not let the nose drop too far, but do not stall.
2. **Landing Site:** Pick a spot within 30° of your nose.
3. **Fuel Selector:** **OFF** (to prevent fire on impact).
4. **Mixture:** **IDLE CUT-OFF**.
5. **Magnetos:** **OFF**.
6. **Flaps:** **FULL** (once the landing is assured to reduce impact speed).
7. **Master Switch:** **OFF**.
8. **Cabin Door:** **UNLATCH** (prevents the door from jamming if the airframe warps).

---

## 2. Ditching in Water (Gulf Crossing)

When flying the **UTP Radial 180** toward Hua Hin, you are over open water. If the engine fails, the 210L’s high-wing design offers good visibility but carries a risk of the nose digging in due to the heavy engine.

### Procedure for Water Landing

1. **Mayday:** Call on **121.5** or current frequency. Squawk **7700**.
2. **Landing Gear:** **UP (Retracted).** * *Warning:* Gear-down ditching usually results in the aircraft flipping inverted upon contact with water.
3. **Flaps:** **30° (Full)**. Aim for the slowest possible touchdown speed.
4. **Approach:** * **High Winds:** Land directly into the wind.
* **Heavy Swells:** Land **parallel** to the swells (on the crest).


5. **Touchdown:** Level wings and maintain a slightly nose-high attitude.
6. **Evacuation:** Exit via doors or windows. Do not inflate life jackets until **outside** the aircraft.

## 3. Standard V-Speeds for the Cessna 210L

These speeds are the foundation for all emergency and normal operations. Memorizing them in both units is highly recommended for CAAT/EASA/FAA standard exams.

| V-Speed | Definition | Knots (KIAS) | MPH (MIAS) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Vso** | Stall (Flaps Down) | **54** | **62** |
| **Vs1** | Stall (Flaps Up) | **63** | **72** |
| **Vr** | Rotation Speed | **65** | **75** |
| **Vx** | Best Angle of Climb | **70** | **81** |
| **Vy** | Best Rate of Climb | **88** | **101** |
| **Va** | Maneuvering (3,800 lbs) | **125** | **144** |
| **Vfe (10°)** | Max Flaps 10° | **140** | **161** |
| **Vfe (Full)** | Max Flaps 10°-30° | **105** | **121** |
| **Vlo (Ext)** | Gear Extension | **140** | **161** |
| **Vlo (Ret)** | Gear Retraction | **105** | **121** |
| **Vle** | Max Gear Extended | **175** | **201** |
| **Vno** | Max Structural Cruise | **165** | **190** |
| **Vne** | Never Exceed Speed | **195** | **224** |
| **Vglide** | Best Glide Speed | **80** | **92** |
| **Vref** | Final Approach Speed | **75** | **86** |

---

### Critical Emergency Rule: "Pitch, Place, Perform"

* **Pitch:** Immediately pitch for **80 KIAS** (92 MPH).
* **Place:** Pick your landing spot (field or water).
* **Perform:** Complete the emergency checklist (Flow/Memory items).












* On Landing Gears then Flaps
* FGUMP - Flaps Gas Undercarriage Mixture Prop

* Leaning
    * Mixture In
    * Throttle at 1500
    * Lean notice increase, when RPM drops put mixture in to highest point.
    * Power up to 1700 and mag check

* Prop Check Course up to 1400
    * Check RPM Decrease
    * Check MP Increase
    * Check Oil Decrese (it would recover after some time)


### Radio Sequence: VTBU to VTPH (270° Radial @ 4500ft)

| Stage | Unit / Frequency | Action | Verbal Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1. ATIS** | **126.4** | Listen for the current Information (e.g., *Information Hotel*) and QNH. | *(Listen only)* |
| **2. Initial Call / Clearance** | **Ground (121.9)** | State your position, ATIS, and your specific flight plan (Radial/Altitude). | *"U-Tapao Ground, [Callsign], Apron B, Information Hotel. Request startup and clearance to Hua Hin via **UTP Radial 270, altitude 4,500 feet**."* |
| **3. The Readback** | **Ground (121.9)** | **Crucial:** You must repeat the Squawk, the Altitude, and the Departure Frequency. | *"Cleared to Hua Hin via UTP Radial 270, climb and maintain 4,500, Squawk 4521, Departure frequency 119.7, [Callsign]."* |
| **4. Taxi Request** | **Ground (121.9)** | Once engines are stable and you are ready to move. | *"Ground, [Callsign], request taxi."* |
| **5. Taxi Readback** | **Ground (121.9)** | Read back the route. Watch for the "Hold Short" instruction. | *"Taxi to Runway 36 via Bravo and Alpha, **Hold Short Runway 36**, [Callsign]."* |

### Key Technical Details for the VTPH Flight

In Thailand (CAAT), VFR cruising altitudes follow the **Semicircular Rule**:

* **Track 000° - 179°:** Odd thousands + 500 (e.g., 3,500, 5,500).
* **Track 180° - 359°:** Even thousands + 500 (e.g., **4,500**, 6,500).
* *Since you are on the 180° radial (Southbound), 4,500 ft is the correct and legal VFR altitude.*

#### Transition to Bangkok Radar

Shortly after takeoff, U-Tapao Tower will hand you off to **Bangkok Radar (119.7)**.

* **Checkride Tip:** When you check in with Radar, always state your current altitude and your assigned altitude.
* *"Bangkok Radar, [Callsign], passing 1,500 for 4,500, on UTP Radial 180."*

### The "Gulf Crossing" Safety Brief (PPL Oral Topic)

Because you are flying to Hua Hin over water, the examiner will ask about **Ditching and Survival Gear**:

* **Life Jackets:** Must be available and accessible (usually worn for Gulf crossings).
* **ELT:** Ensure it is in "ARM" position.
* **Point of No Return:** Know the distance where it is closer to continue to VTPH than to return to VTBU.

To convert these figures for the **Cessna 210L** with the **Continental IO-520-L**, we use the standard aviation conversion of **1 US Gallon = 3.785 Liters**.

Here is the fuel consumption breakdown in liters:

### 1. Fuel Flow by Phase of Flight

| Phase of Flight | Gallons per Hour (GPH) | **Liters per Hour (LPH)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Takeoff / Max Power** | 26 – 30 GPH | **98 – 114 LPH** |
| **75% Power (Cruise)** | 16 – 17 GPH | **61 – 64 LPH** |
| **65% Power (Cruise)** | 13 – 15 GPH | **49 – 57 LPH** |
| **Economy (Lean of Peak)** | 11 – 13 GPH | **42 – 49 LPH** |

---

### 2. Practical Planning Figures

When planning a cross-country flight in the 210L, many pilots use these "block" liter estimates for safety and simplicity:

* **Initial Hour (Climb):** Plan for roughly **80 – 85 liters**. This accounts for the high fuel flow during the taxi, run-up, and the long climb to cruise altitude.
* **Subsequent Cruise Hours:** Plan for **60 liters per hour**.
* **Reserve Fuel:** A standard 45-minute reserve at 45% power requires approximately **30 – 35 liters**.

### 3. Total Fuel Capacity

The 210L has a significant fuel load, which is one of its best features for long-range travel:

* **Total Capacity:** 90 US Gallons = **341 Liters**
* **Usable Fuel:** 89 US Gallons = **337 Liters**

---

### Pro Tip for the IO-520

If you are operating in a metric-dominant region (like Europe or Australia), keep in mind that the **fuel flow gauge** in the cockpit of an older 210L is often calibrated in **Gallons per Hour** or **Pounds per Hour**.

Many pilots use a "rule of 4" for quick mental math: ****. This is slightly conservative (it overestimates burn by about 2 liters), which provides a small extra safety margin.

**Would you like me to convert the cruise speed and range into Kilometers (km) and Kilometers per Hour (km/h) as well?**
