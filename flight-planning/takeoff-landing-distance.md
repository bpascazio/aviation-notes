## 1. Parts of the Runway & Declared Distances

During an oral exam, you may be asked to define the specific lengths available for different phases of flight.

### The Components

* **Clearway (CWY):** A rectangular area beyond the runway, free of obstacles, suitable for an aircraft to make a portion of its initial climb to a specified height (usually 35 ft).
* **Stopway (SWY):** An area beyond the takeoff runway, able to support the aircraft without structural damage, used for decelerating during an aborted takeoff.
* **Displaced Threshold:** A threshold located at a point other than the physical beginning of the runway. The area behind it is available for takeoff but **not** for landing.

### The Four Declared Distances

| Term | Full Name | Calculation / Definition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **TORA** | **Take-Off Run Available** | The physical runway length suitable for the ground run. |
| **TODA** | **Take-Off Distance Available** | **TORA + Clearway**. The total distance available to get airborne and clear a 35 ft obstacle. |
| **ASDA** | **Accelerate-Stop Distance Available** | **TORA + Stopway**. The distance available to accelerate to  and then come to a complete stop. |
| **LDA** | **Landing Distance Available** | The length of runway suitable for the ground run of a landing airplane. (Excludes displaced thresholds). |

## 2. Factors Affecting Performance

Examiners love the acronym **"P.A.T.H."** or **"G.R.A.D.E."** to describe what changes your takeoff/landing distance:

1. **Density Altitude:** High, Hot, and Humid = poor performance. Thinner air reduces lift and engine thrust.
2. **Weight:** Increased weight requires higher lift-off speeds and more energy to stop.
3. **Wind:** * **Headwind:** Decreases ground roll.
* **Tailwind:** Significantly increases ground roll (Rule of thumb: a 10% tailwind can increase distance by 20% or more).


4. **Runway Surface:** Grass, sand, or snow increases friction during takeoff (longer roll) and decreases braking action during landing.
5. **Slope (Gradient):** An upslope increases takeoff distance; a downslope increases landing distance.

## 3. Regulatory Safety Margins (The Percentages)

Calculations in your POH (Pilot’s Operating Handbook) are usually based on **test-pilot performance** in a new aircraft. Regulators require "factoring" these numbers for safety.

### FAA (USA)

* **Landing (Part 135/121):** You must be able to land and stop within **60%** of the effective runway length.
* **Safety Factor:** To find the "Factored Landing Distance," multiply your POH distance by **1.67**.
* **Wet Runway:** Add an additional **15%** () to your calculation.

### EASA (Europe)

* **Landing (Commercial):** Similar to FAA, requires stopping within **60%** (Jets) or **70%** (Turboprops) of the LDA.
* **Safety Factor:** For most light GA aircraft, a factor of **1.43** (for 70%) is used as a baseline for safety planning.
* **Takeoff:** EASA often adds a **15%** safety margin to the takeoff distance ().

### CAAT (Thailand)

The Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand generally aligns with **ICAO and EASA** standards.

* **PPL Standards:** For a PPL checkride in Thailand, instructors expect you to use a **1.6 to 1.7 factor** for landing safety margins to account for tropical humidity and pilot technique.
* **Grass Strips:** If operating at local airfields (like many in Thailand), CAAT guidance suggests adding **15-20%** for dry grass and up to **30%** for long or wet grass.
* **Slope:** For every 1% of upslope, add **10%** to your takeoff ground roll.

## 4. Summary Table for Oral Prep

| Condition | Calculation Adjustment |
| --- | --- |
| **Tailwind (General)** | +20% distance for every 10 knots |
| **Grass Surface** | +15% to +20% (Takeoff) |
| **Wet Runway** | +15% (Landing) |
| **Safety Buffer (PPL Recommendation)** | Add 50% to total calculated distance ( Total) |

> **Pro Tip for the Checkride:** Always tell the examiner: "My POH says I need 1,200 feet, but I am applying a 50% safety factor, so I require 1,800 feet. Since the LDA is 3,000 feet, we are well within safety limits."
