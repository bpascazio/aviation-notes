In aviation shorthand, a touch-and-go landing is almost universally abbreviated as **TGL**.

You will see this used in pilot logbooks, air traffic control (ATC) strips, and flight training syllabi.

### Common Usage Examples:

* **Radio Communications:** While the abbreviation is written as TGL, over the radio, you simply say "Touch-and-go."
* *Example:* "Tower, Cessna 172, requesting **touch-and-go** runway 19."


* **Logbooks:** Pilots often record multiple circuits in a single line.
* *Example:* "VFR local, 5 **TGLs**."


* **ATC Progress Strips:** Controllers use **T/G** or **TGL** to note that an aircraft is not staying on the ground but is staying in the "pattern" or "circuit."
