### 1. The Standard Format (IP TANE)

A helpful acronym for the full ICAO/FAA position report is **IP TANE**:

* **I** – Identification (Callsign)
* **P** – Position (Reporting point or fix)
* **T** – Time (Current time in UTC/Zulu)
* **A** – Altitude (Flight level or altitude)
* **N** – Next Fix (Name of the next reporting point)
* **E** – ETA (Estimated time over the next fix)

### 2. Example Scenarios

In a non-radar environment (where ATC cannot see you on screen), you must provide a full procedural report.

> **Example:** *"UTAPAO Approach, HS-MEW, reporting Eastern Pattaya at 50, Altitude 1000, estimating Jomtien at 0105, Pattaya Beach next."*

### 3. Key Rules for Radio Technique

* **Listen First:** Ensure the frequency is clear so you don't "step on" another pilot.
* **Speak Clearly:** Use a steady pace (not too fast) and keep the microphone close to your lips.
* **Use Phonetics:** Use the standard NATO phonetic alphabet (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie...) for callsigns and fixes.
* **Numbers:** Pronounce digits individually. For example, "Altitude 4,500" is spoken as *"Four thousand five hundred,"* but "Heading 270" is *"Two seven zero."*

When you are operating at an airport where you need to request a specific **outbound radial** (navigating away from a VOR station) and a specific **altitude**, your request should be structured to give the controller your full "navigation plan" in one clear sentence.

### 1. The Startup and Clearance Request

At most medium-sized airports, you can start your engine and then call Ground. You combine the request for your **departure clearance** (which includes your route/radial) and your **taxi** instructions.

**Standard Structure:**

> "[Station Name] Ground, [Callsign], at [Location], request startup and departure clearance via the [Station Name] [Radial] radial, [Altitude], ready to taxi with Information [Alpha]."

---

### 2. A Real-World Example

Let's say you are at Anytown Airport, and you want to fly away from the "ABC" VOR on the **090 radial** (heading East) at **4,500 feet**.

**Your Call:**

> *"Anytown Ground, Cessna 123AB, South Apron, request startup and departure clearance **via the ABC zero-nine-zero radial, four thousand five hundred**, ready to taxi with Information Delta."*

---

### 3. How to Read Back the Response

The controller will give you a clearance that usually follows the **CRAFT** acronym. You must read it back exactly to ensure you both agree on the plan.

* **Controller:** *"Cessna 123AB, cleared as requested. After departure, fly the ABC zero-nine-zero radial, maintain four thousand five hundred. Squawk 4215. Taxi to Runway 27 via Alpha."*
* **Your Readback:** *"Cleared via the ABC zero-nine-zero radial, maintain four thousand five hundred, squawk 4215, taxi to Runway 27 via Alpha, Cessna 123AB."*

### 4. Key Pro-Tips for Radials and Altitudes

* **Phonetics for Radials:** Always say each digit of a radial individually. It’s not "ninety," it is *"zero-nine-zero."*
* **Altitude Units:** For altitudes below 18,000 feet, use "thousands" and "hundreds." For example, 4,500 is *"four thousand five hundred."*
* **Stay on the Apron:** Do not start moving your aircraft until you have heard the words *"Taxi to Runway [X] via [Route]."*

### Quick Reference Table: Phraseology Examples

| Instead of... | Say... | Why? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "Heading 90" | "**Zero-nine-zero radial**" | A heading is a compass direction; a radial is a specific electronic track from a VOR. |
| "Level at 4500" | "**Maintain four thousand five hundred**" | "Maintain" is the standard command for a cruising altitude. |
| "Startup now?" | "**Request startup**" | Using the word "request" makes it clear you are waiting for a green light. |

Would you like me to explain how to set your VOR instrument (OBS) to actually fly that 090 radial once you’re in the air?
