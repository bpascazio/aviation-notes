When you are sitting in the hot seat for your Private Pilot License (PPL) checkride, a communication failure is one of the most likely "scenarios" your examiner will throw at you. Whether you are under the jurisdiction of the **FAA** (USA), **EASA** (Europe), or **CAAT** (Thailand), the core principles remain the same, but the specific "local flavors" can make or break your exam.

## 1. The "Golden Rule" of Failures

Regardless of your country, if your radio goes silent, you must prioritize your tasks in this specific order:

1. **Aviate:** Keep flying the airplane. Don't let a radio glitch cause a stall or a steep turn.
2. **Navigate:** Know where you are and where the nearest safe landing spot is.
3. **Communicate:** Only after the plane is stable should you try to fix the radio or squawk the emergency code.

## 2. Communication Failure Procedures (Squawk 7600)

If you determine your radio is truly dead (and you’ve checked your volume, squelch, and headset plugs), follow these steps:

### The Universal Steps (FAA, EASA, CAAT)

* **Squawk 7600:** This alerts ATC on their radar screen that you have a "Radio Failure."
* **Troubleshoot:** Check your headset, try a second radio if available, and try the emergency frequency **121.5 MHz**.
* **Transmit "Blind":** Continue to make calls as if the radio works. Start with: *"Transmitting blind due to receiver failure..."* and state your intentions. ATC might still be able to hear you even if you can't hear them.

### Regional Nuances for the Exam

* **FAA (FAR 91.185):** If you are in VFR conditions, you must stay in VFR, land as soon as **practicable**, and call ATC by phone once on the ground.
* **EASA (SERA 14083):** EASA recently updated rules (2025). If you are flying VFR and decide to land at the nearest suitable aerodrome, EASA now introduces **Squawk 7601** in some regions to indicate you are continuing in VFR to land. *Check your specific national supplement for this.*
* **CAAT (Thailand):** In Thailand, the procedure is strict: set **7600**, stay in VMC, and head to the nearest suitable airport. If you are near a major hub like Suvarnabhumi (VTBS) or Don Mueang (VTBD), be extremely wary of the heavy commercial traffic; landing at a smaller general aviation airfield is often preferred.

## 3. Light Gun Signals (The Checkride "Must-Know")

If you are approaching a tower-controlled airport without a radio, watch the tower for light gun signals:

| Signal | Meaning (In Flight) | Meaning (On Ground) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Steady Green** | Cleared to Land | Cleared for Takeoff |
| **Flashing Green** | Return for Landing (Followed by Steady Green) | Cleared to Taxi |
| **Steady Red** | Give way to other aircraft / Continue circling | STOP |
| **Flashing Red** | Airport Unsafe / Do Not Land | Taxi clear of runway in use |
| **Flashing White** | N/A | Return to starting point on airport |
| **Red/Green** | **Exercise Extreme Caution** | **Exercise Extreme Caution** |

## 4. Emergency Communications (Distress vs. Urgency)

If the situation is more than just a broken radio—if you are going down or have a medical crisis—you need to use the emergency "Big Two."

### Distress: MAYDAY (3 Times)

**Meaning:** Immediate and grave danger. You require immediate assistance.

* **FAA/EASA/CAAT Standard:** *"Mayday, Mayday, Mayday, [Callsign], [Position], [Nature of Problem], [Intentions]."*
* **Squawk:** **7700** (The "All-Hands-On-Deck" code).

### Urgency: PAN-PAN (3 Times)

**Meaning:** You have a safety concern (e.g., you are lost, low on fuel, or have a minor mechanical issue) but are not in immediate danger of crashing.

* **Usage:** Use this to get priority handling from ATC without declaring a full emergency.

## 5. Aircraft/Boat "Down" or In Distress (SAR)

If you are forced to land in a remote area (common in the mountains of the US, the forests of Europe, or the jungles/islands of Thailand):

1. **Activate ELT:** Ensure your Emergency Locator Transmitter is ON.
2. **Emergency Frequency:** Use **121.5 MHz** (VHF) or **243.0 MHz** (UHF Military).
3. **Marine Cross-Over:** If you are over the Gulf of Thailand or the Mediterranean, and you have a marine radio (or are talking to a boat), the international maritime distress frequency is **VHF Channel 16 (156.8 MHz)**.
4. **Satellite Beacons:** Modern **406 MHz** ELTs are vastly superior because they send your GPS coordinates to satellites instantly.

### Pro-Tip for your Practical Exam:

When the examiner fails your radio, don't panic. **Say out loud what you are doing:** *"I'm flying the airplane first. Now I'm checking my circuit breakers. I'm squawking 7600. I'm looking for the light gun signals."* Examiners love to see a pilot who remains calm and follows a structured process.

Here is the updated guide for your PPL practical exam, now including your legal and ethical obligations to assist other aircraft or vessels in distress—a topic often used by examiners to test your knowledge of **SAR (Search and Rescue)** coordination.

## 1. The "Good Samaritan" of the Skies

As a pilot under **FAA, EASA, or CAAT**, you are part of a global safety network. If you hear a distress call or spot a downed aircraft/boat, you become a **Relay Station**.

### If you hear a MAYDAY or PAN-PAN:

1. **Listen & Record:** Do not immediately key your mic. Listen to see if a Ground Station (ATC) acknowledges. Write down the **position, callsign, and nature of the emergency**.
2. **The Relay:** If ATC does not respond after a few seconds, you must attempt to relay the message.
* *Example:* "Bangkok Control, [Your Callsign], I am relaying a Mayday from [Distress Aircraft] at position [XYZ]..."


3. **Maintain High Altitude:** If you are high, you have a better "radio line-of-sight." Stay high to act as a bridge between the distressed party and ATC.

---

## 2. Assisting a "Down" Aircraft or Vessel

If you physically spot an aircraft wreckage or a boat in distress (flares, SOS smoke, or signaling mirrors):

### The Observation Procedure

* **Aviate First:** Do not let the sight of a crash distract you into a stall. Maneuver safely to stay upwind of any smoke.
* **Mark the Position:** Use your GPS to "Mark" the coordinates. If you don't have GPS, use radial and distance from the nearest VOR or a prominent landmark.
* **Report to ATC:** Give the "Five P's": **P**osition, **P**lane type (or boat color), **P**eople (count survivors if possible), **P**roblem (smoke, sinking), and **P**lan (how long you can stay on station).

### Search and Rescue (SAR) Squawk

* **Squawk 7700:** Even if you aren't the one in trouble, switching to 7700 tells radar controllers "Something critical is happening here."

## 3. Visual Intercept & Communication (Marine/Land)

In regions like the **Gulf of Thailand (CAAT)** or the **Mediterranean (EASA)**, you may be the first to find a boat in distress.

* **Aircraft to Surface Vessel Signals:**
* To acknowledge a message from a boat: **Rock your wings**.
* To direct a boat toward a rescue ship: Circle the distressed boat, then fly toward the rescue ship and **open/close the throttle** (change engine sound) or rock wings.


* **Common Ground-to-Air Signals (Kneeboard Essential):**
* **V:** Require Assistance.
* **X:** Require Medical Assistance.
* **N:** No / Negative.
* **Y:** Yes / Affirmative.
* **:** Proceeding in this direction.

## 4. Jurisdictional Specifics for the Exam

| Jurisdiction | Key Organization | Special Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **FAA (USA)** | Air Force Rescue Coordination Center (AFRCC) | In the US, the Civil Air Patrol (CAP) often handles the ground search. |
| **EASA (Europe)** | Joint Rescue Coordination Centre (JRCC) | Procedures are highly standardized under **SERA**. Expect to be asked about "S" signals on a checkride. |
| **CAAT (Thailand)** | Bangkok RCC / Thai Navy | Heavy emphasis on maritime SAR. Be prepared to discuss **VHF Channel 16** (156.8 MHz) for boat emergencies. |

---

## 5. Emergency Frequencies Summary

* **121.5 MHz:** The International Air Emergency (Guard). Monitor this on your "Comm 2" radio whenever possible.
* **243.0 MHz:** Military Guard frequency (UHF).
* **VHF Channel 16:** International Maritime Distress. (Note: Most aircraft radios cannot tune this; you must relay through ATC).
* **406 MHz:** The frequency used by modern ELTs/EPIRBs to send digital ID and GPS data to satellites.

---

## Practical Exam Pro-Tip: "The Relay Scenario"

The examiner might say: *"You hear a faint Mayday on the radio, but ATC is silent. What do you do?"*
**The winning answer:** "I will wait 10 seconds to see if a closer station responds. If not, I will acknowledge the call to let the pilot know they've been heard, record their position, and then relay that information to ATC on the highest power setting possible. I will remain on station until my fuel state reaches my pre-determined bingo limit."
