# VFR Minimums - FAA, EASA & Thailand CAAT

## Overview

Visual Flight Rules (VFR) minimums are defined by regulatory authorities to ensure safe flight operations. This guide covers VFR minimums for FAA (Federal Aviation Administration), EASA (European Union Aviation Safety Agency), and Thailand CAAT (Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand) regulations, including altitude restrictions over congested areas, distance from people and structures, and experimental aircraft restrictions.
