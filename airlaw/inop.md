## 1. The Decision Flow (The "Can I Fly?" Test)

When you discover inoperative equipment (e.g., a landing light is out), follow this four-step checklist to see if the aircraft is still airworthy:

1. **Is it part of VFR Day Type Certificate?** Check the equipment list in the POH.
2. **Is it listed as "Required" on the Kinds of Operations Equipment List (KOEL)?**
3. **Is it required by 14 CFR 91.205 (FAA) or Part-NCO (EASA/CAAT)?** (See the "ATOMATO FLAMES" list below).
4. **Is it required by an Airworthiness Directive (AD)?**

**If the answer to ALL of the above is "NO," you can fly, PROVIDED you:**

* **Discard/Deactivate:** Turn the equipment off or have a mechanic remove it.
* **Placard:** Place a sticker or note over the instrument/switch that says **"INOPERATIVE."**
* **Pilot Decision:** You must make a final determination that the broken item does not constitute a hazard to the flight.

---

## 2. FAA Requirements (91.205)

For the FAA checkride, you must memorize the required equipment for VFR Day and Night.

### VFR Day: **A TOMATO FLAMES**

* **A** – Altimeter
* **T** – Tachometer
* **O** – Oil Pressure Gauge
* **M** – Manifold Pressure Gauge (for altitude engines)
* **A** – Airspeed Indicator
* **T** – Temperature Gauge (for liquid-cooled engines)
* **O** – Oil Temperature Gauge
* **F** – Fuel Gauge
* **L** – Landing Gear Position Indicator (if retractable)
* **A** – Anti-Collision Lights (Strobes/Beacon - if cert. after March 1996)
* **M** – Magnetic Compass
* **E** – ELT (Emergency Locator Transmitter)
* **S** – Safety Belts

### VFR Night: **FLAPS** (In addition to the Day list)

* **F** – Fuses (Spare set, or Circuit Breakers)
* **L** – Landing Light (Only if flying **for hire**)
* **A** – Anti-Collision Lights
* **P** – Position Lights (Navigation lights: Red/Green/White)
* **S** – Source of Power (Alternator/Battery)

---

## 3. EASA & CAAT (Part-NCO / PEL)

EASA and CAAT (Thailand) use a more simplified "Minimum Equipment" approach but are stricter on lighting and survival gear.

* **Day VFR:** Requires the basics (Airspeed, Altimeter, Compass, Watch).
* **Night VFR:** Unlike the FAA, EASA and CAAT generally require **two-way radio communication** and **SSR Transponder** for all night flights, regardless of airspace.
* **Lighting:** Navigation lights and an anti-collision light system are **mandatory** for any flight between sunset and sunrise.

---

## 4. The "Lighting" Restrictions (Specific Scenarios)

### Scenario A: The Landing Light is broken.

* **Day:** You can fly. Deactivate and placard "Inoperative."
* **Night (Private):** Under FAA, you can legally fly because a landing light is only required "for hire" (instruction or charters). **However**, under CAAT and EASA, if your POH lists it as required for night ops, you are grounded.
* **Safety Tip:** Even if legal, ask yourself: *"Is it safe to land at a dark airport with no landing light?"* (The examiner loves this "Safety Mindset" answer).

### Scenario B: An Anti-Collision Light (Strobe) is broken.

* **Day:** If your plane was manufactured after 1996, you **cannot** fly without it. It is a required safety item.
* **Night:** Absolutely required. Grounded.

### Scenario C: Interior/Instrument Lights are broken.

* **Day:** Legal to fly.
* **Night:** Grounded. You must be able to see your primary flight instruments. (A flashlight/torch is a backup, not a primary legal replacement for instrument lighting).

## 5. Checkride Tip: The "Placard"

Many students fail because they say, *"I'll just ignore the broken gauge."* **Correct Answer:** *"I must verify it isn't required by the 91.205 or the KOEL. If not required, I will have it deactivated and I MUST placard it as 'Inoperative' before I can legally act as PIC."*

---

This is a vital distinction for your checkride, especially since you fly a **BushCat**, which is often registered as an **SLSA** or **ELSA**.

The rules for "broken stuff" change significantly depending on the **Certification Category** of the aircraft. For a PPL oral exam, you must know which set of rules applies to the seat you are sitting in.

---

## 1. Type Certified (Standard)

*Examples: Cessna 172, Piper Archer, Beechcraft Baron.*

* **The Rule:** You must follow **14 CFR 91.213** (FAA) or equivalent EASA/CAAT rules.
* **The Process:** You use the "Four-Step Test" (91.205, KOEL, ADs, Type Certificate). If a piece of equipment is not required, you **deactivate and placard** it.

---

## 2. Special Light Sport Aircraft (SLSA)

*Examples: Factory-built BushCat, Bristell, Sling 2.*

* **The Rule:** SLSA aircraft do not follow the standard "Four-Step Test" in the same way. They are governed by the **Manufacturer’s Requirements**.
* **The Restriction:** If something is broken on an SLSA, you **cannot** simply placard it and fly unless the **Manufacturer (Skyreach)** has explicitly outlined a procedure for that specific item in the Pilot’s Operating Handbook (POH) or Maintenance Manual.
* **The "Gotcha":** In many SLSAs, if *any* equipment installed at the factory is inoperative, the plane is grounded until a mechanic fixes it or the manufacturer provides a letter of authorization (LOA).

---

## 3. Experimental Light Sport (ELSA) & Experimental Amateurbit (EAB)

*Examples: Kit-built BushCat, RV-12, Rans.*

* **The Rule:** These aircraft do not have a Type Certificate. They are governed by their **Operating Limitations** (the piece of paper that stays in the plane).
* **The Process:** Generally, for Experimental aircraft, the pilot has more leeway.
* You still must meet the **91.205** (A TOMATO FLAMES) requirements for the type of flight (Day/Night).
* If a non-required item (like a landing light during the day) is broken, the owner/builder can typically mark it inoperative and fly.


* **The Restriction:** You must ensure the broken equipment doesn't interfere with other critical systems (e.g., a broken radio that is shorting out the entire electrical bus).

## 4. Comparison Table: Can I fly with inoperative equipment?

| Feature | Type Certified (Cessna) | SLSA (Factory BushCat) | EAB / ELSA (Kit/Homebuilt) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Regulation** | 91.213 / Part-NCO | Manufacturer (Skyreach) | Operating Limitations |
| **Can I placard it?** | Yes, if it passes 4-step test. | **Only** if POH allows it. | Yes, if not 91.205 required. |
| **Mechanic Needed?** | To deactivate/remove. | Usually required for any fix. | Owner/Builder can often fix. |
| **Night Lighting** | Must have FLAPS. | Must meet ASTM standards. | Must meet 91.205 + Op Lim. |

---

## 5. Lighting Restrictions: The Big Differences

### Night Flight in SLSAs (BushCat)

Under **EASA and CAAT**, many SLSAs are restricted to **Day VFR Only** by their certificate of airworthiness. Even if you install all the lights (FLAPS), if the manufacturer hasn't certified that specific serial number for Night VFR, you cannot fly it at night.

### Night Flight in EAB (Experimental)

An Experimental aircraft can fly at night **IF** the Operating Limitations issued by the FAA/CAAT/EASA inspector allow it. Usually, they require the aircraft to be equipped per 91.205 (the same lighting rules as a Cessna).

---

## Checkride Strategy: The "BushCat Answer"

If the examiner asks: *"Your BushCat's strobe light is broken. Can you fly today?"*

**The High-Scoring Answer:**

> "It depends on how this BushCat is registered. If it's an **SLSA**, I have to check the Skyreach POH and Maintenance Manual. If they don't explicitly allow flying with an inoperative strobe, I am grounded until it's fixed. If it's an **ELSA/EAB**, I can fly during the **day** if I deactivate and placard it, but I would be grounded at **night** because anti-collision lights are required by 91.205 for night flight."

In the **Skyreach BushCat POH**, the section regarding inoperative equipment is found under **Section 2 (Operating Limitations)** and **Section 6 (Weight & Balance/Equipment List)**.

Because the BushCat is a Light Sport Aircraft (LSA), it does not strictly follow the same "Four-Step Test" as a Cessna 172. Instead, it relies on the **Manufacturer’s (Skyreach) Equipment List**.

---

## 1. The BushCat POH Rules (SLSA vs. ELSA)

### If your BushCat is an SLSA (Factory Built):

* **The Zero Tolerance Rule:** Most SLSAs are certified as a "complete package." The POH generally states that **all equipment installed at the factory must be functional** for the aircraft to be airworthy.
* **The Exception:** You can only fly with a broken item if the **Kinds of Operation Equipment List (KOEL)** in Section 2 specifically lists that item as "Optional" for the type of flight (Day VFR).
* **Manufacturer Authorization:** Unlike a Cessna, if you want to placard something as "Inoperative" that isn't listed as optional, you technically need a **Letter of Authorization (LOA)** from Skyreach.

### If your BushCat is an ELSA (Experimental):

* **The Pilot's Authority:** You follow the **Operating Limitations** issued to your specific tail number.
* **Minimums:** You must still have the items required by **91.205** (A TOMATO FLAMES). If a non-required item (like a landing light during the day) is broken, you may deactivate it, placard it "INOPERATIVE," and log the action.

---

## 2. Night Flight Requirements (The Big "No")

The BushCat POH is very specific about night operations. Under **FAA, EASA, and CAAT**, most BushCats are restricted to **Day VFR Only** unless they have been specifically modified and certified for night flight.

* **POH Limitation:** Section 2 usually states: *"Flight is limited to VFR Day conditions only."* * **The "Lighting" Trap:** Even if you have all the lights (Position, Strobe, Landing), if that sentence is in your POH, flying at night is a violation of your **Operating Limitations**, which is a "Major" fail on a checkride.
* **Required Lighting for Night (if certified):** If your specific BushCat *is* certified for night, the POH/KOEL will mandate:
1. **Anti-Collision Lights** (Strobes/Beacon).
2. **Position Lights** (Navigation Lights).
3. **Instrument Lighting** (Dimmable).
4. **Landing Light** (Required for CAAT/EASA; required for FAA if flying for hire).



---

## 3. The "Placard" for the BushCat

The POH and FAA/CAAT/EASA regs agree on one thing: **You cannot have a "mystery" broken switch.**

* If you are flying an ELSA/EAB and decide to defer an item, it must be **Placarded**.
* **Tip:** Keep a roll of blue painter's tape and a Sharpie in your flight bag. If a gauge fails, tape over it and write "INOP." This shows the examiner you understand the legal requirement to clearly identify broken equipment.

---

### Checkride Strategy: The "Golden Statement"

If an examiner asks about a broken item in your BushCat, say this:

> "Since this is a Light Sport Aircraft, I first check the **Operating Limitations** in Section 2 of my POH. If the item is required by the manufacturer for Day VFR, the plane is unairworthy. If it is not required, I must ensure it is deactivated and **placarded 'INOPERATIVE'** as per Part 91.213(d), and I must personally determine that its failure does not pose a hazard to the flight."

**Would you like me to help you draft a "Master Equipment List" for your specific tail number so you know exactly what is 'Required' vs. 'Optional' before your checkride?**
