To get your Private Pilot License (PPL) in Thailand, you must meet the requirements set by the **Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand (CAAT)**. Since Thailand is an ICAO member state, these requirements are very similar to EASA and FAA standards.

| **Education** | Minimum **High School Graduate** (Grade 12 or equivalent). |
| **Medical** | Must hold a valid **Class 2 Medical Certificate** (issued by a CAAT-authorized center). |
| **Language** | Proficient in reading, writing, and speaking **English** (ICAO Level 4 recommended). |

You must complete a minimum of **40 to 45 hours** of total flight time (depending on the specific flight school's approved syllabus).

* **Practical Test:** A flight where you demonstrate maneuvers, emergency procedures, and navigation.
