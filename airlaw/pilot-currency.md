# Pilot Currency - PPL Checkride Oral Study Notes

## Overview

“Currency” means meeting **recent experience** requirements to act as PIC in certain situations (especially carrying passengers). “Proficiency” is separate: you can be legal but not proficient.

This sheet is written for **FAA PPL** oral prep (because the rules are very specific and commonly tested), and includes **Thailand (CAAT)** notes where the common “recency” concept applies.

## Quick Table (FAA)

| Topic | Requirement | Key Memory Aid |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Flight Review (BFR)** | Every **24 calendar months** to act as PIC | “**24**-month flight review” |
| **Carry passengers (day)** | **3 takeoffs and 3 landings** in the **preceding 90 days** in same category/class/type (if required) | “**3 in 90**” |
| **Carry passengers (night)** | **3 full stop** takeoffs & landings at night in preceding **90 days** (1 hour after sunset to 1 hour before sunrise) | “**3 full-stop at night**” |
| **Recent IFR experience** | IFR currency is separate (not required for VFR PPL), but test questions may mention it | Know it exists |

## FAA Currency (Core Oral Topics)

### Flight Review (14 CFR 61.56)

- **What it is**: A review of flying skills and regulations with an instructor.
- **When required**: Within the preceding **24 calendar months** to act as **PIC**.
- **What satisfies it** (common alternatives):
  - Passing a **practical test** (checkride) for a certificate/rating.
  - Certain FAA “WINGS” phase completions (if applicable).
- **Common gotcha**: A flight review is **not** the same as being passenger-current.

### Passenger-Carrying Currency (14 CFR 61.57)

#### Day passenger currency
- **Requirement**: Within the preceding **90 days**, complete **3 takeoffs and 3 landings**:
  - In an aircraft of the **same category and class** (and **type** if a type rating is required).
- **Touch-and-go**: **Yes—touch-and-go landings count** toward the daytime 3 takeoffs/landings requirement.
- **Where**: No special airport requirement for day (unless aircraft category/class/type or endorsements impose limits).

#### Night passenger currency
- **Requirement**: Within the preceding **90 days**, complete **3 takeoffs and 3 landings to a full stop**:
  - During the period **1 hour after sunset to 1 hour before sunrise**
  - In the same **category/class/type** (if applicable).
- **Touch-and-go**: **No—night passenger currency requires full-stop landings**.
- **Common gotcha**: “Night” for currency uses the **1-hour-after/before** definition, which is **not** the same as the legal **night lighting** definitions used elsewhere.

### Medical & Acting as PIC (14 CFR 61.23 + BasicMed, if applicable)

- **Medical must be valid** for the operation you’re doing (or BasicMed if eligible and used).
- **Common oral angle**: “Are you current if your flight review is good but your medical is expired?”  
  - **No** (you may be flight-review current but not qualified to act as PIC).

### Endorsements vs Currency (Common Confusion)

Currency is **recent experience**. Endorsements are **logbook authorizations** for specific activities, for example:
- **High-performance** (more than 200 HP)
- **Complex** (as applicable)
- **Tailwheel**
- **High altitude** (pressurized aircraft over 25,000’)

You can be **passenger-current** but still **not authorized** to fly a particular aircraft without the proper endorsement.

## FAA “Can I Go?” Quick Scenarios (Oral-Style)

- **Scenario**: Flight review 25 months ago, but you flew yesterday. Can you act as PIC?
  - **No** (need flight review within 24 calendar months or a substitute).

- **Scenario**: Flight review current, but last landings were 120 days ago. Can you take friends up today?
  - **No** (not passenger-current: need 3 takeoffs/landings in last 90 days).

- **Scenario**: You did 3 night landings “touch-and-go” last week. Can you carry passengers at night?
  - **No** (night passenger currency requires **full-stop** landings).

- **Scenario**: You are day passenger-current in a C172. Can you carry passengers in a tailwheel airplane today?
  - **Maybe not**—you need both:
    - Passenger currency (category/class) **and**
    - **Tailwheel endorsement** and any other required endorsements/checkout.

## EASA Notes (General PPL Oral Context)

EASA member states implement rules via EU regulations and national procedures. In oral exams, you’ll usually be expected to know:
- **Recency** requirements exist for carrying passengers and exercising privileges.
- **Training/experience** requirements may be expressed as:
  - Recent takeoffs/landings,
  - Recent hours or dual instruction,
  - Or a proficiency check/training flight depending on aircraft/class and national implementation.

Best practice for EASA oral prep:
- Know where you would verify it: **Part-FCL** + national authority guidance and your ATO/DTO SOPs.

## Thailand (CAAT) Notes (PPL Oral Context)

Thailand generally aligns with **ICAO** principles with CAAT implementation. CAAT’s exact “recency to carry passengers” wording can be published in CAAT regs, AIP/NOTAM guidance, and/or your school/club SOPs.

For Thailand PPL oral prep, be ready to cover:
- **Recency exists**: You must meet defined “recent experience” to carry passengers (commonly framed similarly to “takeoffs/landings within X days”). The exact numbers are jurisdiction-specific.
- **Medical validity**: You must hold a valid medical appropriate to the privileges you’re exercising.
- **Ratings/privileges**: Night passenger-carrying (if you have night privileges) typically has stricter recency expectations than day.
- **Operator/club requirements**: Clubs often impose stricter recency than the legal minimum (e.g., recent dual, checkouts).

Best practice answer (Thailand):
- “Before carrying passengers, I verify I meet **CAAT recency** requirements and any **club SOP** requirements, and I ensure my **medical** and privileges are valid.”

## Practical “Currency” Checklist (Use Before You Fly)

- **PIC qualification**
  - Flight review within **24 calendar months** (FAA)
  - Valid **medical** or **BasicMed** (as applicable)
- **Passenger currency**
  - Day: **3 takeoffs/landings in 90 days**
  - Night: **3 full-stop** takeoffs/landings at night in **90 days**
- **Aircraft authorization**
  - Required endorsements (tailwheel, high-performance, complex, high altitude, etc.)
- **Legal + safe**
  - Personal minimums met, recent practice in the planned conditions, and a conservative go/no-go decision
