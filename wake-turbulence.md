## What is Wake Turbulence?

### Definition

**Wake Turbulence**: Wingtip vortices created by an aircraft generating lift. These are invisible spirals of air that trail behind the aircraft.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Created when aircraft is **generating lift** (takeoff, landing, in flight)
- **Most intense** when aircraft is heavy, clean (no flaps), and slow
- **Sinks and drifts** with wind
- **Can persist** for several minutes
- **Invisible** - cannot be seen

### How Wake Turbulence Forms

1. **High pressure air** flows under the wing
2. **Low pressure air** flows over the wing
3. **Pressure difference** causes air to curl around wingtips
4. **Vortices form** - rotating columns of air
5. **Trail behind aircraft** - left wingtip rotates clockwise, right wingtip rotates counterclockwise

## Wake Turbulence Behavior

### Sink Rate
- **Wake turbulence sinks** at approximately 300-500 feet per minute
- **Sinks below** the generating aircraft's flight path
- **Most dangerous** at low altitude (takeoff and landing)

### Drift
- **Wake turbulence drifts** with the wind
- **Drifts downwind** from the generating aircraft's flight path
- **Can affect** aircraft on parallel runways or nearby areas

### Persistence
- **Wake turbulence can persist** for several minutes
- **Most intense** immediately after generation
- **Gradually dissipates** over time
- **Can be re-energized** by wind or other factors

### Weather Effects
- **Calm wind**: Wake turbulence sinks and spreads slowly
- **Crosswind**: Wake turbulence drifts downwind
- **Turbulent conditions**: Wake turbulence may be more intense or unpredictable

A: **Heavy** category (typically 500,000+ lbs)

**Q: What category is an Airbus A380?**

A: **Super** category (typically 1,200,000+ lbs)

### Time Separation

**Q: How long should you wait behind a Heavy aircraft before takeoff?**

A: **2 minutes minimum** behind Heavy or Super aircraft for small aircraft.

**Q: Do you need to wait behind a Light aircraft?**

A: **No specific time requirement** - use judgment. Small aircraft typically don't create significant wake turbulence.

**Q: What if ATC clears you for takeoff immediately after a Heavy aircraft?**

A: You can **request additional spacing** or **wait 2 minutes** before taking off. As PIC, you're responsible for wake turbulence avoidance.

### Distance Separation

**Q: How should you take off behind a Heavy aircraft?**

A: 
- **Wait 2 minutes** behind Heavy aircraft, OR
- **Take off before the preceding aircraft's rotation point** (if safe), OR
- **Climb above the preceding aircraft's flight path**

**Q: How should you land behind a Heavy aircraft?**

A: 
- **Wait 2 minutes** behind Heavy aircraft, OR
- **Land beyond the preceding aircraft's touchdown point**, OR
- **Stay above the preceding aircraft's flight path** until final approach

**Q: How should you cross a runway behind a Heavy aircraft?**

A: 
- **Wait 2 minutes** behind Heavy aircraft, OR
- **Cross above the preceding aircraft's flight path** (at least 1,000 feet above)

### Avoidance Techniques

**Q: What is the best way to avoid wake turbulence on takeoff?**

A: 
- **Take off before the preceding aircraft's rotation point** (if safe)
- **Climb above the preceding aircraft's flight path**
- **Stay upwind** of the preceding aircraft's flight path

**Q: What is the best way to avoid wake turbulence on landing?**

A: 
- **Land beyond the preceding aircraft's touchdown point**
- **Stay above the preceding aircraft's flight path** on approach
- **Stay upwind** of the preceding aircraft's flight path

**Q: What should you do if you encounter wake turbulence?**

A: 
- **Maintain aircraft control** - wake turbulence can cause sudden attitude changes
- **Apply appropriate control inputs** to maintain flight path
- **Do not overcorrect** - wake turbulence is usually brief
- **Climb or turn away** from wake turbulence if possible

### VFR vs IFR

**Q: Does ATC provide wake turbulence separation for VFR aircraft?**

A: **No** - ATC does not provide wake turbulence separation for VFR aircraft. VFR pilots are responsible for their own wake turbulence avoidance.

**Q: Does ATC provide wake turbulence separation for IFR aircraft?**

A: **Yes** - ATC provides wake turbulence separation for IFR aircraft, but pilots should still be aware and request additional spacing if needed.

### Wake Turbulence Behavior

**Q: How does wake turbulence behave?**

A: 
- **Sinks** at approximately 300-500 feet per minute
- **Drifts** with the wind (downwind)
- **Persists** for several minutes
- **Most intense** when aircraft is heavy, clean, and slow

**Q: When is wake turbulence most dangerous?**

A: **At low altitude** during takeoff and landing, when there's less altitude to recover from wake turbulence encounters.

## Important Safety Reminders

1. **Wake turbulence is invisible** - you cannot see it
2. **Most intense** when aircraft is heavy, clean (no flaps), and slow
3. **Sinks and drifts** - stay above and upwind
4. **Can persist** for several minutes
5. **VFR pilots** are responsible for their own separation
6. **Request additional spacing** from ATC if needed
7. **Be especially cautious** behind Heavy and Super aircraft
8. **Take off before rotation point** or **land beyond touchdown point**
9. **Stay above preceding aircraft's flight path** when possible
10. **Stay upwind** of preceding aircraft's flight path
