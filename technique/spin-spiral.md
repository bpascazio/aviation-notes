In aviation, the universal mnemonic for spin recovery in most light aircraft is **PARE**. Because a spin is essentially an "aggravated stall" where one wing is more stalled than the other, the goal of the procedure is to stop the rotation and then break the stall.

### The PARE Procedure

| Step | Action | Why? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **P** | **Power: Idle** | Eliminates the "nose-up" pitch force from the propeller and prevents excessive airspeed during the recovery dive. |
| **A** | **Ailerons: Neutral** | Using ailerons can actually worsen the spin. For example, trying to roll "away" from the spin increases the angle of attack on the already-stalled wing, deepening the spin. |
| **R** | **Rudder: Full Opposite** | This is the primary tool to stop the rotation. You apply full rudder pressure against the direction of the turn (the "spinning" motion). |
| **E** | **Elevator: Forward** | Once the rudder is applied, push the yoke or stick forward. This reduces the angle of attack to "break" the stall and allow the wings to fly again. |

### Executing the Recovery

1. **Stop the Rotation:** Hold the opposite rudder and forward elevator until the spinning stops.
2. **Neutralize:** As soon as the rotation stops, **neutralize the rudder**. If you keep it held, you might enter a spin in the opposite direction.
3. **Recover from the Dive:** The airplane will now be in a steep, nose-down dive. Smoothly pull back on the elevator to return to level flight.
4. **Manage Airspeed:** Be careful not to pull back too aggressively, which could cause a secondary stall or exceed the aircraft's structural G-limits.

### Important Note for the Cessna 210

As mentioned previously, the Cessna 210 is a heavy, high-performance aircraft. Most 210 models are **not certified for intentional spins**.

* **Aft CG Issues:** In a 210, a center of gravity (CG) that is too far aft can make a spin "flat." In a flat spin, the elevator becomes shielded by the fuselage, making it nearly impossible to lower the nose and recover.
* **Check the POH:** Always follow the specific emergency procedures in your Pilot’s Operating Handbook (POH), as some high-performance aircraft have specific timing or control nuances.

It is critical to distinguish between a **spin** and a **spiral dive** because the recovery actions for one can actually make the other much worse.

In a **spin**, the aircraft is stalled, but in a **spiral dive**, it is still "flying"—just in a very steep, descending turn.

### Key Differences at a Glance

| Feature | **Spin** (Stalled) | **Spiral Dive** (Not Stalled) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Airspeed** | Low and stable (near stall speed) | **High and rapidly increasing** |
| **G-Load** | Low / Constant | **High and increasing** |
| **Controls** | Mushy, sluggish, or unresponsive | Effective, firm, or "heavy" |
| **Engine Noise** | Low (wind noise is quiet) | **High (loud rushing wind)** |

### How to Tell the Difference

The most reliable indicator is your **Airspeed Indicator (ASI)**.

* **If the airspeed is low and the needle is steady:** You are in a **Spin**. One wing is stalled more than the other, creating the rotation.
* **If the airspeed is high and the needle is buried or moving toward the red line:** You are in a **Spiral Dive**. The aircraft has "rolled over" into a steep dive, and the weight of the aircraft is pulling it faster and faster toward the ground.

### Recovery: Two Very Different Paths

#### 1. Spiral Dive Recovery

**Goal: Reduce speed and level the wings.**

1. **Power to Idle:** Immediately stop the acceleration.
2. **Level the Wings:** Use coordinated aileron and rudder to roll the aircraft back to a wings-level attitude.
* *Warning:* Do not pull back on the yoke until the wings are level, or you will tighten the spiral and increase the G-load, potentially overstressing the airframe.


3. **Ease Out of the Dive:** Once level, smoothly pull back to return to level flight.

#### 2. Spin Recovery (PARE)

**Goal: Break the stall to stop the rotation.**

1. **Power to Idle.**
2. **Ailerons Neutral.**
3. **Full Opposite Rudder.**
4. **Elevator Forward** (to break the stall).
5. **Neutralize Rudder** once rotation stops and ease out of the dive.

### Special Caution for the Cessna 210

The Cessna 210 picks up speed incredibly fast in a spiral dive due to its "clean" aerodynamic design. If you misidentify a spiral dive as a spin and apply "forward elevator" without leveling the wings first, you will accelerate toward **** (Never Exceed Speed) almost instantly, which can lead to structural failure.

In a training environment, a spiral dive is typically entered by mishandling a turn or allowing the nose to drop during steep banking. Unlike a spin, which is a stalled condition, a spiral dive is a high-speed maneuver where the aircraft remains flying but is descending rapidly in a tightening circle.

### How a Spiral Dive is Entered

According to flight training demonstrations, there are two primary ways to enter a spiral dive for practice:

* **From a Steep Turn [[01:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd5bkXecRMU&t=62)]:** This is the most common real-world cause. While in a steep bank (usually greater than 45 degrees), if the pilot fails to maintain back-pressure on the elevator, the nose will drop below the horizon. Because of the steep bank, the lift is directed horizontally rather than vertically, causing the aircraft to accelerate rapidly toward the ground in a spiral.
* **From a Climbing Turn [[00:44](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd5bkXecRMU&t=44)]:** If an aircraft is in a steep climbing turn and "over-banks," the nose may fall through the horizon. If the pilot does not immediately level the wings and correct the pitch, the aircraft will transition into a diving spiral.

### Signs of Entry [[01:13](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd5bkXecRMU&t=73)]

As you enter the spiral, you will notice:

1. **Rapidly Increasing Airspeed:** Unlike a spin, the airspeed needle will move quickly toward the red line ().
2. **Rapid Altitude Loss:** The altimeter will unwind quickly.
3. **Increasing G-load:** You will feel yourself being pressed into your seat as the turn tightens.

### Training Safety (HAZEL/HALT Checks) [[00:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd5bkXecRMU&t=16)]

Before practicing this entry, instructors perform safety checks to ensure the aircraft and area are prepared:

* **H**eight: Ensure sufficient altitude for recovery.
* **A**rea: Clear of other traffic and built-up areas.
* **S**ecurity: No loose items in the cabin that could fly around.
* **E**ngine: Check gauges and ensure the engine is performing correctly.
* **L**ookout: Perform clearing turns to check for other aircraft.

**Crucial Warning:** In high-performance aircraft like the Cessna 210, a spiral dive can exceed structural limits () in seconds. Recovery must prioritize **leveling the wings before pulling back** on the yoke to avoid overstressing the airframe [[01:21](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd5bkXecRMU&t=81)].
